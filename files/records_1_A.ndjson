{"_id":"57f33efab50ad45c7692179c","title":"Let the Dim Light Shine","subtitle":"In his exhibition, filmmaker-photographer Ashok Ahuja plays with light, space, time and colour.","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ashok Ahuja&rsquo;s Hotmail ID reveals a few things about him &mdash; he is most likely a creature of habit and nostalgia, with the sensibility of a man who maps the stars, and has a mischievous eye out for secrets in public places. Ahuja is a creative man, playing with simple things, the basics &mdash; shadow and light, singular and plural, colour or the absence of it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At &ldquo;Allured&rdquo;, his ongoing show at Gallery Espace, we trip over the different styles and themes that Ahuja the photographer has explored, however, all governed by Ahuja the filmmaker. The photographs are arranged as single frames or in clusters, depending on how he wants to tell the story.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;A lot has to do with space and light but it has been brought together by an element of time. The narratives are embedded in the images, you see textures, colours and time, there is no person but you see life and fill in the blanks,&rdquo; he explains, as we walk past one of the more intimate installations, Untitled 1999, which has been laid out like an architect&rsquo;s plan.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The images that have been presented as part of the master plan are Ahuja&rsquo;s interpretation of time, the functional and dysfunctional, life, chaos, neglect and neighbours. We enter the house through the door and make our way through a drawing room, scan the kitchen, politely look away from the bathroom, and curiously peek into the bedroom. Shot on a digital camera that had the capacity of a single megapixel way back in 1999, the fuzzy pictures are a reality check, showing you that life is without filter and rather lacklustre.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In a more recent work, Japan Shutters, the photographs feature a series of shutters in modern Japan, painted with scenes that depict what life was like in the past. Arranged in quick succession, the frames create an illusion of walking down a street in Japan, with some pictures representing modern life, including a scooter, garbage bag, or a half-open shutter that spins time in a warp. &ldquo;It does not end with just the idea and the imagination. If you notice, you will see the uneven edges of pictures that have been printed on rice paper, and it ties up with Japanese culture, making it a complete experience,&rdquo; says Ahuja, 65.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The auteur at large is drawn to objects but not as things in themselves; he sees them as forms, shapes, colours, textures, even as ideas.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Discussing the thought process behind the work A Rose is a Rose is a Rose, he says, &ldquo;Objects have within them multiple possibilities and alternative realities. The world is an alluring place built from our perceptions, each of us lives in a unique one constructed from his or her individual engagement&rdquo;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the pioneers of digital art in India, Ahuja&rsquo;s first show of inkjet prints and computer animation was held in 2003. &ldquo;Technology and the digital medium allows you to create your own reality and gives free rein to your imagination. With technology, a chair needn&rsquo;t be just a chair, it is what I see when I look at things &mdash; it can be an object, a space, an idea, a mood. It sets off a process and I just follow it,&rdquo; says Ahuja.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Allured will be on display at Gallery Espace, 16 Community Centre, New Friends Colony till&nbsp;October 15.

{"_id":"57f33ff238a70549f03f66d5","title":"At the Last Count","subtitle":"An exhibition at DAG Modern discusses the formation and disbandment of Group 1890, and the individual art practice of its members.","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The India of the &rsquo;60s was a rather precarious nation-state struggling to find its feet after the 1962 Sino-Indian war. While the country struggled to overcome a bruised economy, the field of art had its own struggles. Several of the Mumbai Progressives had departed to the West to discover their unique language in art, and others in India were on a lookout to find ideologically like-minded practitioners, with whom they could unite under a single umbrella. It was during the period of such uncertainty that Group 1890 was formed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unlike most other groups of the era &mdash; including the Progressive Artists Group, the Bengal Group and the Cholamandal Artists Group &mdash; this was not confined within geographical borders, neither did its members share a similar oeuvre. Though it could not sustain for long, with just one exhibition of its members, months after it was born in 1962, it remains significant even 50 years after its inception.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;It created something significant, a body of work under each individual artist that had merit and its own identity,&rdquo; says Kishore Singh, Head, Exhibitions and Publications, DAG Modern.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The curator has put together an exhibition that traces the evolution of each of the 12 members that comprised the group. Up at DAG Modern, Hauz Khas, the display ascertains the conviction that though their celebrated consolidation failed, individually each artist made a lasting impact.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The introduction is made through a Kishor Parekh photograph. In the winter of 1962, standing in the Qutub Minar premises are Jeram Patel, Himmat Shah, Jyoti Bhatt, J Swaminathan, Rajesh Mehra, Raghav Kaneria, Balkrishan Patel, Ambadas, Gulammohammed Sheikh and SG Nikam. Eric Bowen and Reddappa Naidu are absent, but they were in cognizance of the manifesto, initially drafted by J Swaminathan, who was the chief driving force behind the group. While a copy of it is reproduced in a publication accompanying the exhibition at the gallery, Singh notes how the manifesto was exceptional in putting the image as sacrosanct.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The name of the group was derived from the address of art collectors Jayant and Jyoti Pandya&rsquo;s Bhavnagar (Gujarat) home, where the artists met. A document issued stated the group&rsquo;s &ldquo;goal&rdquo;, which was &ldquo;to launch a fearlessly critical and resolute movement for unleashing truly creative energies, to open genuine vistas of expression&rdquo;. If Patel was to popularise blowtorch on burntwood, Shah was reckoned for his terracotta and clay works. Jyoti Bhatt documented the folk and tribal arts of Saurashtra in his photographs, accompanied by Kaneria. Swaminathan&rsquo;s work introspected the miniature and neo-tantric tradition, and Sheikh turned to figurative narratives reflecting varied contemporary issues. While Bowen and Ambadas were to continue their practice in Scandinavia, Mehra came to be known as one of the finest art teachers at College of Art, Delhi, and Naidu drifted to the Cholamandalam Artists Group. Nikam and Patel, meanwhile, faded into oblivion.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The group managed to get Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to inaugurate its first and sole exhibition in 1963 at AIFACS in Delhi. The exhibition opened to much critical acclaim, but none of the works on display found buyers. While the catalogue did not feature images of any of the works being exhibited, Singh has scanned through the reviews and interviews to locate them. In his curatorial exhibition, he has successfully traced the evolution of the artists since.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though several factors are said to have contributed to the dismemberment of the group &mdash; including &ldquo;disinterest&rdquo; of Jeram Patel and interspersing of its members &mdash; art critic Prayag Shukla notes that &ldquo;the narrative of them stayed together&rdquo;. It served a crucial purpose too. As Sheikh notes, &ldquo;It was a crucial moment in the shaping of our work and ideas&hellip; the presence of 1890 remained deeply embedded in our psyche because it not only enabled us to unleash the unknown reserves of energy but also became instrumental in opening up multiple avenues of explorations, both in your work and ideas.&rdquo;</p>\n<div class=\"footnote\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The exhibition is on at DAG Modern, 11, Hauz Khas Village, till December 14.

Hoping to give the discussion a push in the Delhi University (DU) campus, the gender forums of several colleges have come together to host a film festival.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;We wanted to do something where people can form a community to come together and discuss various gender and sexuality issues,&rdquo; says Anjali Chauhan, senior coordinator of Parivartan, the gender forum of Kirori Mal College. She adds, &ldquo;Every college has picked a theme as per which they have decided which movie to screen. Our theme is moral policing around sexuality so we screened Aligarh.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The six-day-long festival, an initiative by Parivartan, will also screen movies such as Fandry, That Girl in Yellow Boots, The Little Mermaid among others. Utpal Gore, of Astitva &mdash; the gender forum of Ramjas College shares that the idea was to cover the various branches of gender issues. He says, &ldquo;Gender is a very pervasive concept. If one says women are oppressed, then another can say that Dalit women are more oppressed than others so we&rsquo;ve included things such as intersectionality as well,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;It is for this reason that we will showcase Carol, as it is the only film with a lesbian protagonist.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The film festival is an open to all event. Chauhan says, &ldquo;Anyone can come and watch the movies, not just students. Keeping it limited just to college students would have beaten the purpose as we want to get more and more people talking about these concerns.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The need for a film festival on gender issues is reiterated by students in other colleges as well. Paras Gupta (name changed), a third year student from Ramjas College, says that it is a welcome change that students in the varsity are taking up gender issues.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He adds, &ldquo;I am a non-conformist dresser and this becomes a problem for me, especially during election days.

{"_id":"57f356c79657dc5c5b9dccea","title":"Delhi continues to top world's most polluted megacities list: WHO","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e2e34a4ac2d218b1a46","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Delhis air is the worst among world megacities, the <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/World-Health-Organisation\">World Health Organisation</a> (WHO) confirmed recently, even as IndiaSpend&lsquo;s #breathe network of air-quality sensors reported fine-particulate-matter (PM2.5) levels were almost four times above daily safe levels, on average, for the seven-day period from September 22 to 28, 2016.<br /><br />For long-term exposure, these 24-hour levels are nearly 11 times above the WHO health standards.<br /><br />Over the monsoon, Delhi's air was relatively cleaner because the rain and wind diminished the impact of pollutants. But with the season changing, three of our five sensors in the <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/National-Capital-Region\">National Capital Region</a> (NCR) registered \"poor\" to \"very poor\" air-quality levels from September 22 to 28, meaning prolonged exposure affects healthy people and \"seriously impacts\" those with existing disease.<br /><br />In December 2015, week-long analysis of data from #breathe devices showed Delhi's <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/air-pollution\">air pollution</a> was one-and-a-half times worse than in Beijing, IndiaSpend reported.<br /><br />In 2012, with one million deaths, China reported the highest toll from PM2.5 and PM10 pollution. At the time, India followed, reporting 621,138 deaths, nearly 10 per cent of the global toll (6.5 million deaths) associated with outdoor and indoor air pollution.<br /><br />However, between 2011 and 2015, in a comparison of megacities with population above 14 million, Delhi's ambient air-pollution levels were worse than Beijing and Shanghai, an IndiaSpend analysis of the WHO's 2016 data of global ambient air pollution showed.<br /><br />Delhi recorded a PM10 level of 229 &micro;g/m&sup3;, followed by Cairo with 179 &micro;g/m&sup3; and Dhaka with 158 &micro;g/m&sup3; -- the top three megacities with the most polluted air globally. Beijing and Shanghai were sixth and seventh on that list.<br /><br /><strong>China air-pollution death toll highest in 2012 but Delhi ambient air worse</strong><br /><br />India's capital was the only megacity to record a PM10 level above 200 &micro;g/m&sup3;, exceeding the WHO air quality standard of 20 &micro;g/m&sup3; by more than 900 per cent.<br /><br />Beijing and Shanghai reported ambient air pollution levels of 108 and 84 &micro;g/m&sup3; respectively.<br /><br />Even Kolkata and Mumbai -- recording PM10 levels of 135 &micro;g/m&sup3; and 117 &micro;g/m&sup3; respectively -- had air worse than the biggest Chinese cities.<br /><br />The WHO guideline for annual mean levels for PM10 is 20 &micro;g/m&sup3; and for PM2.5 is 10 &micro;g/m&sup3;. For 24 hours, the levels should not exceed 50 &micro;g/m&sup3; (for PM10) and 25 &micro;g/m&sup3; (for PM2.5). The WHO sourced its data on India's air pollution from the Central Pollution Control Board, Environmental Data Bank.<br /><br />PM10, or coarse particulate matter with diameter between 2.5 and 10 micrometers, are primarily made up of dirt and dust from farming, factories and roads, and caused due to the crushing of rocks and soil.<br /><br />Most air-pollution deaths are caused by fine, invisible particles, called PM2.5, about 30 times finer than a human hair. These pollutants, if inhaled deep into the lungs, can cause heart attacks, strokes, lung cancer and respiratory diseases, and are known to pose the greatest risk to human beings. Their measurement is considered to be the best indicator of the level of health risks from air pollution, according to the WHO.<br /><br /><strong>Gwalior, Allahabad report worst levels in India</strong><br /><br />Within India, the smaller cities of Gwalior and Allahabad measured the worst levels of ambient air pollution at PM2.5 levels of 176 &micro;g/m&sup3; and 170 &micro;g/m&sup3; respectively. A significant portion of northern India falls in a zone with \"critical\" air pollution-reporting PM2.5 levels of over 70 &micro;g/m&sup3; in the WHO's mapping of air pollution and population.<br /><br />The WHO's new air-quality model, it's most comprehensive yet, is based on information from satellite measurements, air-transport models and ground-station monitors for more than 3,000 urban and rural areas across the world. It analyses this with population data in a grid pattern area of 10 sq km. It was developed by the WHO in collaboration with the University of Bath and confirms that 92 per cent of the world's population lives in places where air quality levels exceed WHO limits.<br /><br /><strong>11,297 persons per sq km in Delhi at risk</strong><br /><br />Up to 97.5 per cent of Delhi's 16.8 million people live in urban areas, and the city has a density of 11,297 persons per sq km-making it one of the densest regions in the country -- according to Census 2011 data.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Air pollution continues take a toll on the health of the most vulnerable populations - women, children and the older adults,\" said Dr Flavia Bustreo, Assistant Director General at the WHO.</p>\n<div class=\"last7brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some three million deaths every year are linked to exposure to outdoor air pollution, according to the WHO.

{"_id":"57f35eb6f61f17499f46c736","title":"Peace of heart","subtitle":"Chayan Adhikari and Ujwal Nagar reveal what makes Advaita click","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Listening to Advaita perform, one wonders, how do musicians with different sensibilities organically come together to create soulful strains? The Delhi-based Indian fusion band Advaita has been doing it for 15 years. The band includes Abhishek Mathur (guitar), Anindo Bose (keyboards), Chayan Adhikari (lead vocals, Western), Aman Singh Rathore (drums), Suhail Yusuf Khan (vocals, sarangi, Hindustani), Ujwal Nagar (vocals, Hindustani), Mohit Lal (tabla) and Gaurav Chintamani (bass). While performing, the eight rise above self and genre and seamlessly come together to produce a truly unique and ingenious sound described as the &ldquo;Advaita experience&rdquo; by their fans.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Stating that the group&rsquo;s music cannot be categorised as Hindustani classical or Western music, Chayan says, it is something unique, a combination of putting things together. &ldquo;We build a piece together which is not the intention but just happens because it has the sense of all eight of us. The result is a fine art which can be heard as a song which makes you feel more alive. The purpose is to provide five to six minutes of peace to the hearts of people.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The band which is now working on two singles currently while also doing different versions of their earlier songs recently performed at Gurugram at an event organised by Parx, the casual lifestyle brand. What amazes the listeners is how coming from diverse musical background the artists gel so well. Pointing that diversity helps, Ujwal observes that each one brings in his experiences while composing. &ldquo;It is a great educational point as well because one is able to learn something new every time from each other. We have all grown up listening and inspiring each other, learning and exchanging different ideas.&rdquo; He goes on to add with members with experience and training in Hindustani classical music, it becomes easier to identify and understand the mood and nuances of a raga.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">On how the idea of fusion of classical and rock came about , Chayan says it is neither a forced idea nor intentional. &ldquo;It is just not about Indian musicians trying to be experimental and getting out of comfort zone. It is connecting with Indian music and the fascination about the way it goes from something very slow to something very climactic. From very gradual elaboration of the raga it goes to middle base composition and then probably ends with very fast composition.&rdquo;</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chayan points out that among what influences their fusion style is the classical Indian music innate spirituality and depth besides the old and new classic rock music of groups like Pink Floyd and Coldplay. Other styles which impacted the group are the electronic music of Massive Attack, Zero 7 and Air and the blending mode of east and west by artists Talvin Singh and Nitin Swahney. &ldquo;AR Rahman too has been big influence.&rdquo; Clarifying, he says, the idea is not to sound like him but using acoustics and electronic instruments.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Advaita as an indie band finds creating of one&rsquo;s own space a big challenge in India. Emphasising the need to find a distinctive sound and style which is original, Chayan observes that this is essential for everyone listening to a band&rsquo;s song to identify it with the group. &ldquo;This will make you feel really great and survive for a longer period. Also, if you are doing something original then there is no direct competition. I guess this model gives enough money so one does not have to look at different avenues but pursue what you really want to do. It is very important as an artist to find you own grounding and certain style and work on it without comprising or giving it up.&rdquo; While highlighting on importance of patience on the part of the band to deal with struggle phase, Ujwal says finding like minded people enables the group to work for a long. &ldquo;Finding right path and balance is all you need. Initially its just about performing or practising but later you discovers that you have to be really versatile and open to all the collaborations. Importantly you must possess originality otherwise someone will come and cover you up.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Coming from Vedas, Advaita, which means indivisible, resonates with the idea and the concept of the band which means everything is one. &ldquo;With all the musical influences, it all comes together as a song which defines the whole,&rdquo; sums up Ujwal.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/peace1475567267871.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf66aebfe246bd8ebdfe5","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"chayan adhikari"},{"text":"ujwal nagar"},{"text":"advaita"},{"text":"music"},{"text":"anindo bose"},{"text":"aman singh rathore"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/peace-of-heart/article9174481.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-04T07:48:06.154Z","udate":"2016-12-17T09:46:16.575Z","expirydate":"2017-10-04T07:48:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f35eb6f61f17499f46c738","publishedOn":"2016-10-04T07:52:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"priority":99999,"audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"chayan adhikari,ujwal nagar,advaita,music,anindo bose,aman singh rathore","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

I love the shades of pinks&mdash;deep pink, salmon pink, baby pink&mdash;and purples. I love the butterfly-shaped leaves too, mantharai elai leaf used to be our throwaway plates during my growing-up years. The leaves would be stitched together with small sticks, normally the thin mid rib of the leaflets of the coconut frond. It was a laborious process but the end product was eco-friendly. That is how I was introduced to the usefulness of this tree. Years later, I learnt to my surprise that the bark of this tree was the main ingredient in kanchanara guggulu, a drug used in treating galaganda (goitre) and hypothyroidism.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kanchanara guggulu consists of the bark of Bauhinia variegata, triphala (the rinds of the fruits of Terminalia chebula, Terminalia bellirica and Emblica officinalis), ginger, pepper, pippali, cardamom, cinnamon and the bark of Crataeva nurvala. An acharya had said that with triphala, 50 per cent of diseases can be cured. It seems to be true as many drugs have triphala as their ingredient. Many women I meet seem to have thyroid problems. Earlier, it seemed that only older people had thyroid, but now I see that many youngsters are also suffering from the complaint.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Consult your vaidyar if you have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism as she can probably start you on treatment protocol at once. The general consensus among physicians seems to be one 50 mg tablet, thrice a day. This should be taken after food as the drug could sometimes be a gastric irritant. Some vaidyars recommend a spoon of Sudarshan churanam to be taken twice a day with cold water on an empty stomach to act against hypothyroidism.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now for your diet, do avoid foods that are vayu-enhancing and also other goitrogenic foods. Foods such as bok choy, broccoli, Brussel sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, kale, kohlrabi, mustard, mustard greens, radish, soybeans and turnips are best avoided if you have thyroid issues. Other foods which also have goitrogens but to a lesser extent are bamboo shoots, peaches, peanuts, peas, pine nuts, spinach, strawberries, sweet potatoes, millets and almonds. So what is left you well ask. The leaves of drumstick plant are highly recommended as these are rich in iodine and iron. You can make a koottu or poriyal with the tender leaves. A tasty soup can be made by pressure cooking the leaves with a few small onions, garlic and a little green gram dhal. You drink it as it is or grind and strain it. This soup also improves vascular health and prevents hair fall.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Meat, poultry, eggs and butter (all organic or grass-fed) and smaller-sized fish can help avoid thyroid. Avocados, guavas and pomegranates are fruits which are non-goitrogenic. Normally the allopathic drug is reduced 25 mg at a time and frequent tests are done to monitor the levels of the Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, free T3 and free T4. Combine this new drug and food regimen with a daily practice of Ujjayi pranayama. So pretty flowering trees, common drumstick plants and yoga can get your thyroid glands into good working order.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The writer is retired Additional Chief Secretary of Tamil Nadu.

Peals of thunder rent the sky. Wrapped in the creeping mist, it seems to be the perfect setting for plunging into Stephen King&rsquo;s 55th novel End of Watch.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Come with me. You can look forward to meeting Brady Hartsfield, who is in a vegetative state at the Traumatic Injury Clinic. Five years ago, he was responsible for the notorious Mercedes Massacre, in which he had plotted to blow up a rock concert brimming with teenagers where eight people were killed and many injured as he mowed down a queue of people. A man pulled up, red-faced and gasping. &lsquo;It was a car. Tore through the crowd like a mowing machine. I don&rsquo;t know how many he<br />hit. We were penned in like hogs because of the posts they set up to keep people in line. He did it on purpose and they are laying around up there like&hellip;oh man, dolls filled with blood.&rsquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And now he&rsquo;s preparing to do it again.<br />Hang on a minute! Things are not what they look like. You will have to move on, go past Brady&rsquo;s gaping, the fixed stare and the drool in Room 217 of the Lakes Region Traumatic Brain Injury Clinic, to find that things are not exactly as they seem to be.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In reality, he is all there and has acquired new lethal powers, which will help him wreak havoc without even having to leave his bed. He is already using his warped mind to move small objects in the cloistered hospital room&mdash;the blinds, the bedsheets, the door to the bathroom&mdash;and has the ability of getting into the bodies of his victims to influence their thoughts in such a way that he can propel them to end their lives.<br />You will meet retired police detective Bill Hodges, the unassuming hero of the earlier two books, who owns a detective agency named Finders Keepers. But the sand in his own hour-glass is running out, as he sets out with his &lsquo;Watson&rsquo;, his partner Holly Gitney, to investigate what on the surface seems to be a string of suicides with links to the Mercedes Massacre.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Soon it becomes obvious that each death has one thing in common: Brady. They are all connected in one way or the other to Brady, who is aware that it was Holly&rsquo;s blow that has reduced him to his comatose state.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Together Bill and Holly set out to investigate a murder-suicide which seems to be linked to the Mercedes Massacre and are sucked into the dark vortex of a macabre case whereby they jeopardise, not just their own lives but those of friends as well. The lives of Jerome Robinson and his young daughter</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Barbara too are at stake as Brady Hartsfield returns for his revenge.<br />In End of Watch, the last of this trilogy, Stephen King&rsquo;s masterpiece takes the reader to a rarified zone; a dimension where the supernatural melts and mingles with crisp detective fiction to reveal our fragile existence in the world of controlled fear. The result? If there be one, it&rsquo;s the reader, who has found an unput-downable roller coaster ride of a cat-and-mouse chase that moves to a dizzy climax.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">-&nbsp; <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http://www.newindianexpress.com/author/Ganesh-Saili\" target=\"_blank\">Ganesh Saili</a></span></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/curtain1475568706215.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecfaa8bec71f6cb1a63559","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"magazine"},{"text":"curtain"},{"text":"mercedes massacre"},{"text":"stephen king"},{"text":"novel"},{"text":"end of watch"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.newindianexpress.com/magazine/2016/oct/01/curtain-falls-on-the-mercedes-massacre-1518486.html?pm=216","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-04T08:12:04.975Z","udate":"2016-12-17T10:09:41.043Z","expirydate":"2017-10-04T08:12:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f36454b50ad45c76921988","publishedOn":"2016-10-04T09:02:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"priority":99999,"audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"magazine,curtain,mercedes massacre,stephen king,novel,end of watch","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

These processes, which have been studied in countless experiments, are so complex that scientists have been developing mathematical models in order to fully understand them,\" said Stefano Fusi, the paper's senior author. \"The model that we have developed finally explains why the biology and chemistry underlying memory are so complex, and how this complexity drives the brain's ability to remember.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Memories are widely believed to be stored in synapses, tiny structures on the surface of neurons. These synapses act as conduits, transmitting the information housed inside electrical pulses that normally pass from neuron to neuron. In the earliest memory models, the strength of electrical signals that passed through synapses was compared to a volume knob on a stereo; it dialed up to boost (or down to lower) the connection strength between neurons. This allowed for the formation of memories.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These models worked extremely well, as they accounted for enormous memory capacity. But they also posed an intriguing dilemma.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The problem with a simple, dial-like model of how synapses function was that it was assumed their strength could be dialed up or down indefinitely,\" said Dr. Fusi, adding, \"But in the real world this can't happen. Whether it's the volume knob on a stereo, or any biological system, there has to be a physical limit to how much it could turn.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When these limits were imposed, the memory capacity of these models collapsed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So Dr. Fusi, in collaboration with fellow Zuckerman Institute investigator Larry Abbot offered an alternative- each synapse is more complex than just one dial, and instead should be described as a system with multiple dials.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In 2005, Drs. Fusi and Abbott published research explaining this idea. They described how different dials within a synapse could operate in tandem to form new memories while protecting old ones. But even that model, the authors later realized, fell short of what they believed the brain, particularly the human brain, could hold.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We came to realize that the various synaptic components, or dials, not only functioned at different timescales, but were also likely communicating with each other,\" said Marcus Benna, the first author of today's Nature Neuroscience paper. \"Once we added the communication between components to our model, the storage capacity increased by an enormous factor, becoming far more representative of what is achieved inside the living brain.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr. Benna likened the components of this new model to a system of beakers connected to each other through a series of tubes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"In a set of interconnected beakers, each filled with different amounts of water, the liquid will tend to flow between them such that the water levels become equalized. In our model, the beakers represent the various components within a synapse,\" explained Dr. Benna. \"Adding liquid to one of the beakers -- or removing some of it -- represents the encoding of new memories. Over time, the resulting flow of liquid will diffuse across the other beakers, corresponding to the long-term storage of memories.''</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Both the researchers are hopeful that this work can help neuroscientists in the lab, by acting as a theoretical framework to guide future experiments, ultimately leading to a more complete and more detailed characterization of the brain.</p>\n<div id=\"content\" class=\"content\">\n<div id=\"storyContent\" data-height=\"370\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"While the synaptic basis of memory is well accepted, in no small part due to the work of Nobel laureate and Zuckerman Institute codirector Dr. Eric Kandel, clarifying how synapses support memories over many years without degradation has been extremely difficult,\" said Dr. Abbott. \"The work of Drs. Benna and Fusi should serve as a guide for researchers exploring the molecular complexity of the synapse.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The technological implications of this model are also promising. Dr. Fusi has long been intrigued by neuromorphic hardware, computers that are designed to imitate a biological brain.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Today, neuromorphic hardware is limited by memory capacity, which can be catastrophically low when these systems are designed to learn autonomously,\" said Dr. Fusi. \"Creating a better model of synaptic memory could help to solve this problem, speeding up the development of electronic devices that are both compact and energy efficient -- and just as powerful as the human brain.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This paper titled, \"Computational principles of synaptic memory consolidation&rdquo; is published online in Nature Neuroscience.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baab05ecbc9256e95c174b","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"brain"},{"text":"memories"},{"text":"neuromorphic"},{"text":"stefano fusi"},{"text":"author"},{"text":"marcus benna"},{"text":"nature neuroscience"},{"text":"neuroscientists"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2016/oct/04/find-out-how-brain-makes-new-memories-preserving-the-old-1524975--1.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-04T09:18:49.249Z","udate":"2017-01-07T06:20:19.970Z","expirydate":"2017-10-04T09:18:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f373f9bf560c49baf48381","publishedOn":"2016-10-04T09:21:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/brain1475573324697.png","priority":99999,"audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"brain,memories,neuromorphic,stefano fusi,author,marcus benna,nature neuroscience,neuroscientists"}

As a result, the Medical Research Council awarded one of the first joint grants to these five leading biomedical research institutions.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;And in return each research centre provides its expertise to complete the jigsaw needed to find a cure for HIV- from patients, to the right doctors, the right diagnostic technology, the mathematician to analyse results and so on. CHERUB was born.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>CHERUB (Collaborative HIV Eradication of viral Reservoirs: UK BRC) is a new approach to HIV therapeutics in the UK.</p>\n<p>It is one of the first co-operatives of UK Biomedical Research Centres to engage internationally in one of the most exciting new fields of biomedical research, that of HIV cure.</p>\n<p>CHERUB brings together, amongst others, clinicians, virologists, immunologists, molecular biologists and mathematical modellers under the umbrella of the NIHR.</p>\n<p>Over 30 medical researchers attended a kick-off meeting, and it was acknowledged that so many world-leaders in the field had never been in one room together, even on the conference circuit.</p>\n<p>This collaboration is the most significant attempt to find a cure for HIV in the UK.</p>\n<p>And in the six years since, great progress has been made. The 'Kick and Kill' study will recruit 50 HIV study participants, in which researchers activate HIV infected cells which are 'asleep'.</p>\n<p>By waking them and treating them with an HDAC inhibitor drug, the body's own immune system is encouraged to fight the disease.</p>\n<p>HIV is a virus infection that is treatable using Antiretroviral Therapy (ART). ART works by stopping HIV from copying itself and spreading. ART reduces the amount of virus in the blood stream to such low levels that it prevents the virus from being passed on to others, and gives the body's immune system a chance to recover.</p>\n<div id=\"content\" class=\"content\">\n<div id=\"storyContent\" data-height=\"640\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<p>But ART alone cannot cure HIV. This is because it only works on HIV infected cells that are active, and most cells infected with HIV in the human body contain resting or sleeping virus. These cells represent an invisible reservoir of HIV, and are one of the reasons it is so difficult to cure the infection. If ART is stopped, usually the virus returns.</p>\n<p>There is a strong interest amongst people living with HIV, as well as researchers, to look at different ways that could help to cure HIV and allow people to remain healthy without needing lifelong medication.</p>\n<p>Sarah Fidler, the co-Principal Investigator on the study, said, &ldquo;This first participant has now completed the intervention and we have found it to be safe and well tolerated. Only when all 50 study participants have completed the whole study, by 2018, will we be able to tell if there has been an effect on curing HIV. Professor John Frater's lab in Oxford will lead on the tests and assays to determine if the trial has had an effect.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Professor Jonathan Weber, Chair of CHERUB Scientific Steering Committee and Director of Research for the Faculty of Medicine at Imperial College London, said, &ldquo;CHERUB has made great progress since it was born six years ago. We are now actively recruiting patients to test the 'Kick and Kill' theory.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;NOCRI was instrumental to this research starting. We are all thoroughly committed to finding a cure for HIV, but if the collaboration between this set of HIV researchers had not been prompted at that meeting six years ago, this simply would not have happened,&rdquo; Weber added.</p>\n<p>The NIHR Office for Clinical Research Infrastructure (NOCRI) brings world-leading investigators, scientific industries and research facilities together, acting as a catalyst to make vital research happen.</p>\n<p>By brokering crucial relationships, NOCRI helps deliver pioneering health breakthroughs, bringing drugs, devices and diagnostics to patients faster.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/hiv1475573257321.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecfaa8bec71f6cb1a63559","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"hiv patients"},{"text":"national institute for health research"},{"text":"\\"},{"text":"uk"},{"text":"nocri"},{"text":"oxford university"},{"text":"university of cambridge"},{"text":"imperial college london"},{"text":"king's college london"},{"text":"university college london"},{"text":"cherub"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2016/oct/04/ray-of-hope-for-hiv-cure-courtesy-new-collaboration-1524965--1.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-04T09:27:55.292Z","udate":"2017-01-07T06:21:02.158Z","expirydate":"2017-10-04T09:27:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f3761b27ad245c9160c21f","publishedOn":"2016-10-04T10:07:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"priority":99999,"audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"hiv patients,national institute for health research,\\,uk,nocri,oxford university,university of cambridge,imperial college london,king's college london,university college london,cherub"}

Built by Rajaraja Cholan (ruled 985-1014 AD), the temple is Thanjavur&rsquo;s best-known landmark.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As I catch sight of the 216-foot vimanam (tower), I understand why &lsquo;big&rsquo; is barely enough to describe this temple. The 80-tonne kalasam (dome) on top sits heavy and imposing, a single granite block. Historians believe it was hoisted on a 6 km-long ramp, an ancient Egyptian technique used in building their pyramids.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This UNESCO-listed temple is not painted in kitschy colours like other temples in the south. But the colour it lacks on the walls, it makes up for with frescoes on the ceiling, some of the blues and indigos popping, a thousand years on, in images of parrots, peacocks, angels and lotuses.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"http://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/ckeditor_images/article/2016/9/30/ARTa.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"227\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Colourful frescoes in the temple</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">History does not say for sure if Rajaraja Chola was a pious man, but he certainly seemed to be a man of great ego. The temple was initially called Rajarajeeshwaram, an ode to either the supreme god (eeshwar) or king Rajaraja. Tamil inscriptions at the base of the walls praise his contributions to the temple, including land and building resources, and hundreds of dancers and musicians.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are unexpected delights among the temple carvings, which are visible to me only when my guide points them out. Hidden amid the flying angels and minor gods is the face of a Westerner with a top hat and bush shirt. Remember, this temple was built in 1010 AD, centuries before there is any record of the first Europeans arriving in south India.<br />Following the Cholas (Rajaraja son&rsquo;s Rajendra outdid his father in his military conquests), the Nayaks (16th century) and then the Marathas (17th to mid-19th century) ruled over Thanjavur. Both dynasties were responsible for building and adding bits to the Royal Palace, which encloses one of the city&rsquo;s hidden treasures, the Art Gallery.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Art Gallery is a museum with an incredible collection of over 300 bronze and stone sculptures from the 2nd century onwards. A room is devoted to the region&rsquo;s reigning deity, Shiva, in the form of Nataraja, the cosmic dancer. Another room contains a m&eacute;lange of statues representing the wedding between Shiva and Parvati, presided over by the bride&rsquo;s brother, Vishnu.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I walk in a mild daze through these sculptures, wondering about why I have never seen (or even heard of) this during any of my earlier visits to Thanjavur.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We head to the Saraswati Mahal Library, which houses over 30,000 rare Indian and European manuscripts. Another highlight of this palace complex is the Maratha Durbar Hall, once the royal audience enclosure. With its vibrantly painted arches and ceilings, and colourful wall murals of a religious nature, this section of the palace feels like a psychedelic painting come to life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While Thanjavur paintings are popular for the elaborate paint and stonework, local artists believe demand is unpredictable, and there is not enough money in this field. There are the veena makers, the bronze sculptors, the thalai aati bommai (bobbling head doll) makers and the third generation weavers from Saurashtra in Gujarat.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My cultural exploration of Thanjavur ends with lunch at Svatma&rsquo;s Aaharam fine-dine restaurant. Like the other arts here, this meal too is an exploration of Thanjavur&rsquo;s soul, transporting me to a culinary world beyond the idli and sambhar that have sadly come to represent south Indian cuisine.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As I ready to leave the city the next day, I muse that the word thanjam in Tamil means asylum, and what could be a more appropriate for the name of a town that still provides a haven for troubled arts and artisans.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">-&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http://www.newindianexpress.com/author/Charukesi-Ramadurai\" target=\"_blank\">Charukesi Ramadurai</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/art11475573555927.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baab05ecbc9256e95c174b","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"art"},{"text":"soul"},{"text":"thanjavur"},{"text":"big temple of thanjavur"},{"text":"brihadeeswara temple"},{"text":"fergusson"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.newindianexpress.com/magazine/2016/oct/01/art-and-soul-of-thanjavur-1518456--1.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-04T09:32:54.298Z","udate":"2016-12-17T09:46:18.965Z","expirydate":"2017-10-04T09:32:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f37746b50ad45c76921a59","publishedOn":"2016-10-04T09:38:00.000Z","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","priority":99999,"audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"art,soul,thanjavur,big temple of thanjavur,brihadeeswara temple,fergusson","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57f37a55f61f17499f46c8a5","title":"Doyen of digital dialogues","subtitle":"Ashok Ahuja with his artworks on display at Gallery Espace in Delhi","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The last 15 years have been especially poignant. Time has been of the essence. Each passing day has seemed like a lifetime with limitless possibilities beckoning the pioneer of digital art, Ashok Ahuja, to explore the precincts of his imagination to construct a body of work that is self-fulfilling.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The autodidact visual artist and illustrator&rsquo;s new exhibition called &lsquo;Allured&rsquo; brings together parts of that journey through visual dialogues that have developed as a result of a thriving quest for knowledge. Interestingly, each of his work is as unassuming as the artist himself, and the beauty of it all lies in their overarching simplicity. In a room filled with white canvases treated with a multitude of forms, structures, lights and colours, he stands humbly amid it all, looking more content than ever. &ldquo;There is no better feeling than this,&rdquo; he says in his faint but assured voice.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Inkjet prints on rice paper thoughtfully interpret his ideas in this exhibition that brings art from all these years. As he allows us to peek into his world of thoughts, he shares softly that most of them are triggers from his experiences of the world he lives in. They are abstract expression of what he perceives from external stimulus.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I am in a constant state of enchantment with what life throws at me. As an avid observer, I&rsquo;ve learnt to tune into what&rsquo;s happening all around and extract from it, what my senses would like to develop further,&rdquo; says Ahuja.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">His artistic efforts are simple renditions of his straightforward thoughts. We walk over to the space where what looks like a few vertical white blocks are kept.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ahuja explains, &ldquo;Titled &lsquo;Plan&rsquo;, the work is an architect&rsquo;s outline of a dwelling. The work highlights two components&mdash;one is the basic external structure that an architect will draw, and the second is an elaborate internal plan of what constitutes a home. Broken into different frames, one shows the entrance, the next depicts the staircase, another shows the bedrooms, bathroom, kitchen, a terrace, all with unambiguous detailing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A few steps from there is a panel of works inspired from his visits to Japan. &ldquo;Once shutters of shops have been brought down, you&rsquo;ll see distinct artistic depictions on many of them. Some of these are two dimensional images that juxtapose traditional themes with present-day elements,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A flight of stairs above us is another frame where hangs an explicit description of the outward and inward physical self of a human being.<br />&ldquo;This is as real as it gets. It&rsquo;s true for all human beings,&rdquo; says Ahuja, who thinks that a piece of art isn&rsquo;t worthy enough if it does not uplift the soul. Art is as much about discovery and perception as it is about making and creating.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">His experiments with imaging technology go back a decade when this medium hadn&rsquo;t caught everybody&rsquo;s fancy. One&rsquo;s got to be brave enough to do different things, he feels. &ldquo;It will single-handedly bring out the essence of an individual&rsquo;s creative virtues,&rdquo; Ahuja says. He considers him immensely fortunate to be able to communicate with his audience through his works.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Many don&rsquo;t even have a relevant medium to share their ideas,&rdquo; he says in a mellow voice. An ardent believer in infinite possibilities, he is prepared for every turn that life takes. It&rsquo;s only with an open mind, he says, evolution is possible.<br />It&rsquo;s interesting how he prefers to remain anonymous despite being an artistic virtuoso. Recognition is not something he personally seeks. Rather, he politely refuses to talk about himself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Why talk about me when I&rsquo;ve put everything I feel on the walls in front of you. Let them engage in a dialogue with you,&rdquo; he says, adding, &ldquo;The art is any day more important than the artist. I am a small fry in front of what I produce, so I am happy being a silent spectator.&rdquo; There are times when he stands in a corner, watching people view his work, but never does he say a word. He lets each story unfold through the frames that hang on the stark white walls, allowing the experiential narratives besiege your senses with stories from a well-lived life.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/ashok1475574339065.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baab05ecbc9256e95c174b","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"ashok ahuja"},{"text":"artworks"},{"text":"gallery espace"},{"text":"delhi"},{"text":"allured"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.newindianexpress.com/magazine/2016/oct/01/doyen-of-digital-dialogues-1505829.html?pm=231","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-04T09:45:57.398Z","udate":"2016-12-17T09:47:23.891Z","expirydate":"2017-10-04T09:45:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f37a55f61f17499f46c8a7","publishedOn":"2016-10-04T10:17:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"priority":99999,"audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"ashok ahuja,artworks,gallery espace,delhi,allured","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57f37b5e27ad245c9160c264","title":"Godavari Gundu","subtitle":"A translation of the Tamil short story Godavari Gundu written in 1961 by Thi Janakiraman.","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8f88ebfe246bd8ebd873","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The scales of the wastepaper man were the handiwork of a goldsmith who made ornaments for the gods. It would show six <em>palams</em> even if you placed an elephant on it. So what chance did a six-month bundle of newspapers have? Applying castor oil to my eyes and not looking this-way-that-way even for a second, I watched over the needle intently.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Is <em>amma</em> there?&rdquo; asked a voice at just that moment; I lifted my head. The woman stood there grinning from ear to ear. Her name was Ganga or Godavari or something&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t remember properly. Some river&rsquo;s name, of that I was sure. She had something stuffed on her hip, hidden under the ends of her sari.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s inside. Go in,&rdquo; I said. The pleats of her sari rustling, she crossed the hall and went in, that woman.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I peered at the needle of the scales. It was a divine needle, after all! Sixty newspapers or even half a newspaper? Would it falter? <em>Uuhmmm</em>&hellip; When would the time dawn for me to get my own scales? Ishwara!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I uttered the last sentence loudly. Which worm would put up with such swindling?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What, <em>saami</em>! You are saying such things about these scales. It will show the difference between a blank card and a written one, <em>saami</em>. If you have doubts, go fetch a pair of scales from the shop&hellip; why should I earn a bad name from you?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Where was the time to go to the shops? And at nine-thirty in the morning, would a shopkeeper attend to his business or lend his scales? Not even half an hour left for me to start for office&mdash;I had yet to bathe and eat! Enough if I saw a few rupees, I felt. Otherwise why would I have left a Sunday and chosen a &lsquo;home says go-go office says come-come&rsquo; of a Thursday to sell old newspapers!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darkness seemed menacing in two or three ways. It was two months since the last date for payment of electricity bills. If left unpaid today, darkness would envelop us. Who could wrestle with that hurricane lamp, which would jump up and down &lsquo;tak tak&rsquo; and would be snuffed out in a minute?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The daughter was sitting inside with a long face. Wouldn&rsquo;t go to school, she said. Some priest had to be given eight annas. This was another nuisance, the convent nuisance&mdash;as if the school fees weren&rsquo;t enough, money was collected in the name of every saint. If she didn&rsquo;t get the eight annas, she would not be in peace today.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Six months&rsquo; daily newspapers, weekly magazines, all of them amounted to six and a half rupees.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;How much did he give?&rdquo; asked Gowri, as soon as the paper fellow left.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Six and a half rupees.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;For six months paper-<em>aa</em>?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Why are you fretting now? Should have done it when he was here.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I was talking inside.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t come here and nag.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say anything. I need two rupees.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Two rupees? What for?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I need it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;The electricity bill is three and a quarter rupees, an eight anna for your daughter, for you two rupees. What will I do with the remaining three-fourth rupee&mdash;tiffin, betel leaf, areca nut shavings, bus fare!&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I have packed tiffin for you &mdash;peppered beaten rice.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Coffee?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve kept some in the thermos flask.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;&lsquo;Betel leaf?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;That also I&rsquo;ve folded and kept.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Ok, I have enough bus fare for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, those three days. What about Monday?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What about it now? We&rsquo;ll see about that later.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;How will we see?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Ask that singer Subramaniayyar.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All the seven chords of my voice died down. It had been Gowri&rsquo;s habit for the past two years to use Subramaniayyar&rsquo;s name to seal my lips. In the year nineteen hundred and fifty-six, the singer Subramaniayyar took ten rupees from me, saying that he would return it the next day. He engraved the word &lsquo;tomorrow&rsquo; on the wall of the mind. Because it is said that you would never recover your loan if you didn&rsquo;t ask for it, I began asking from the year nineteen hundred and fifty-nine. He ran and hid, smooth-talked, begged, but money alone he never parted with.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the end, he came one day. &ldquo;It seems you know the manager in the Talaivaasal office. My son has finished his studies. For the past year he has sent out a hundred applications. No job&hellip; Will you please see him and&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Ok,&rdquo; I replied. Now I hid from him. As soon as he&rsquo;d see my head, he&rsquo;d start, &ldquo;Did you see that manager in Talaivaasal&hellip;&rdquo; Seeing his tuft and his green cycle, even a mile away, I would enter into any nearby street as fast as my feet would allow. The words &ldquo;did you see that manager in Talaivaasal&rdquo; rose in my mind and chased me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Why do you need two rupees?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Gangabai wants it&hellip; Come here,&rdquo; Gowri said, raising her voice.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gangabai came. A double barrel. Hair half grey. A Maharashtrian-style sari tucked between the legs. Black beads on the neck. Well-combed plait twisted into a wheel at the back of the head. About fifty years of age. She took out a bronze vessel from the ends of her sari and kept it in front of her.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;She wants us to keep this Godavari <em>gundu</em> and give her two rupees,&rdquo; said Gowri.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Godavari <em>gundu</em> was a huge vessel. You could cook two big measures of rice in it. Scrubbed with tamarind, it shone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you the one who kept a bronze vessel a couple of months ago and borrowed a rupee?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yes. That was the Nachiar Kovil vessel. A one-measure pot!&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t even redeemed that yet!&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I will redeem this one and that in a month. I am terribly short of money now.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I had seen that Nachiar Kovil pot just half an hour ago. It was kept upturned in the mango-wood loft above the kitchen shelf. I had been looking at it for the past two months. When a couple of guests arrived for the Ganesha festival, Gowri even cooked rice in it, if I remembered right.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been two months. And you couldn&rsquo;t even redeem for one rupee that small pot. And now this?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think like that. In fifteen days if I don&rsquo;t come take these two, then you ask me.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;No, &rsquo;<em>ma</em>&hellip; Just take it and leave. Our own necks are choked with lack of cash. I am not in a position to give you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What do you mean, mustn&rsquo;t say! You yourself saw, no? That I gave papers to that paper fellow and got some money,&rdquo; I replied, my footsteps guiding me to the backyard to bathe. In a minute Gowri followed me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t have two rupees, why don&rsquo;t you give at least one&hellip;&rdquo; she dragged on the words.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;No rupee or kupee.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s begging, can&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;And whom will I beg from&hellip;&rdquo; I rolled my eyes. &rdquo;If I want even a &lsquo;single tea&rsquo; at four in the evening, I have to jingle someone else&rsquo;s pocket. One-rupee loan she will give, it seems. Don&rsquo;t ask me anything now. It&rsquo;s late. I have to bathe.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even after I came back from the bath I saw Gangabai standing in the hall.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Frowning, I went into the kitchen.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&rdquo;Why are you snarling? She doesn&rsquo;t have, that&rsquo;s why she&rsquo;s asking.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&rdquo;Even here we don&rsquo;t have.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;<em>Mkum</em>&hellip; We don&rsquo;t have! As if she&rsquo;s asking you simply? She&rsquo;s pledging something and then only asking for money. If she goes to the shop he will give her thirty rupees for that Godavari gundu. If she pledges such a big thing for just a rupee, it must be a head-rolling crunch, no?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have any compassion at all, is it? You will give that Singer Subramaniayyar tens and twenties and don&rsquo;t mind running after him. But this innocent thing, this poor creature is asking for just a rupee, keeping a three-measure bronze vessel as pledge&hellip; For that you are making such a fuss.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I came to a decision in a flash. &ldquo;See here, if she wants, ask her to take a rupee. And it should be returned in ten days.&rdquo; I handed over the rupee.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She who went to the hall came back in a trice. The Godavari <em>gundu</em> shone brightly in her hand.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You know, if she had kept it at the Sait&rsquo;s shop, he would have given her ten rupees.&rdquo; Gowri kept it on the floor, lifted it up and swirled it around, as if fondling a child.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;<em>M&hellip;m</em>. Ten rupees, it seems. He will also charge fifteen rupees interest.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Poor thing. Don&rsquo;t know what difficulty she is in. Kept this and took a rupee. If she has to pledge something, she must be in a terrible state, poor thing. If her husband had been smart enough, will she be suffering like this?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Dattoji Rao is not a man without any means. He also earns something, no?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What kind of earning he does? Like a seasonal bird. He has to run here and there, and push ahead and earn. They need one full gunny bag of red gram alone for three months.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;For his brains and education, that is all he can earn.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gowri kept looking at the Godavari <em>gundu</em> again and again when she served me food. Navarathri was round the corner. At least on one of the nine days if she didn&rsquo;t put it on the fire she wouldn&rsquo;t have any peace.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On my way to the office I kept looking at the entrance of the Konganeswaran temple. As was his wont, Dattu was sitting there. The perennial smile on the face. You ought to draw a portrait of Dattu. Such a fine face and body. A chest neatly split into two. A child&rsquo;s stomach. Broad shoulders. Medium height. An old Peshwa regal look. A drooping moustache. He was about fifty-five. But you would think he was about forty. Not a single grey hair. One look at Ganga and you would guess she was fifty. Only because he was her husband you would presume he would be above fifty. Otherwise you wouldn&rsquo;t put him beyond forty.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dattu wouldn&rsquo;t budge from the <em>pial</em> of the Konganeswaran temple. They always came there to fetch him. The priests who belonged to his community. He neither had the learning nor the capacity to mug up the chants necessary for a priest&rsquo;s profession. He went as a helper. He would hold out his hand for a <em>dakshinai</em> of one or two annas. If you asked him to eat, he would. He usually sat in the temple <em>pial</em>, one leg over the other, grooming his moustache with his middle finger.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If there was a <em>bhajan</em> in any <em>matham</em>, he would go there, clutching a mridangam in his right hand. With just a single beat &lsquo;dhim-dhim-dharu dhim-dhim-dharu&rsquo; he would keep the beat to all the tunes. Besides that, he could bang &lsquo;thakajunu thom&rsquo; three times for the finale. Otherwise he didn&rsquo;t know anything more about beats. But there was something pleasing about his music&mdash;like his smile.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The man never got angry. Even if you scolded him. Always a smile. Never walked fast. Never in a flutter. Never raised his voice.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">His house was ten houses away from the temple. His own house too. How could he afford to pay rent? It was a house that he had inherited. But to recognise that it was indeed a house you needed a research-oriented mind. A big platform four feet above the street. Must have been part of the base of a big house. At the back end of the platform you could see a black and grey wall. The only sign that revealed that there must have existed a house earlier was this: the wall of the single-roomed tenement. That was where Gangabai did everything, including cooking and sleeping; the rest of the time she sat on the steps which led into the street at the end of the platform. When I crossed the house, she was opening the door, clutching some packet&hellip; The rupee I had given hadn&rsquo;t been wasted, after all. I don&rsquo;t know why I had haggled so cheaply for just a rupee! Does meanness need a time and place to descend on a human being?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gangabai&rsquo;s sari had at least fifteen patches as far as the eye could see. Dattoji&rsquo;s dhoti would have a few more, not less. It was a good thing that Dattu had taken on a job that involved eating&mdash;at least he had that much luck. And that job actually came with money. But even that seemed to have slackened now. Who fed the priests like in the days of yore? The days of giving <em>veshti</em> and towel on ritual occasions too were gone. Why else would Dattu have a sieve of a <em>veshti</em>? At least if the priest knew mantras and stuff there was a chance of getting by. Of what use was an unskilled person?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I couldn&rsquo;t fathom why people believed that the creator would provide for the stomach. But here, the pot meant for feeding the stomach itself had been pawned.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why had I created such a fuss to give a single rupee? Why hadn&rsquo;t I given a rupee without taking that Godavari <em>gundu</em>? As usual, these questions popped up in hindsight.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All the places where I usually saw Gangabai came to mind. Wherever there was a marriage, an <em>annadhaanam</em> or a ritual such as <em>samaaradhanai</em>, you could find her. Big or small, in any wedding she would wait for the hosts, VIPs and friends to eat, a Poona tumbler in hand, seated on the <em>pial</em>, for the last round of eating when they would serve the dregs of the food. In the temple <em>samaraadhanai</em> during Navarathri, however, you would see her in the first round of eating itself. If there was nothing, you would find her wandering around with a tin dabba, trying to sell puffed rice or beaten rice which she herself had flattened. Today it looked as if she didn&rsquo;t have even that.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dattu&rsquo;s forefathers were believed to have been priests in the palace. These vessels, Nachiar Kovil pot and Godavari, all of them must have been amassed by the family at that time. Dattu&rsquo;s education wouldn&rsquo;t even earn him an iron pot. Also, looking at him, no one would want to give him such a cheap thing. Why, he looked so regal, moustache and all! Oh lord, you made him poor, yes, but couldn&rsquo;t you have at least made him decrepit and dark, like something a dog had torn apart! Did you have to make him tall and handsome, moustache and all? To give alms one ought to feel a hint of pity and compassion. You created him to appear rich, but you omitted to bestow him with luck and brains&hellip; <em>che</em>! Was god such a below-average creator?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What, <em>ayya</em>! So deep in thought today! You&rsquo;re looking at the wall! At the floor! You scribble something! You get up and stand!&rdquo; commented his colleague Pakkirisami loudly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Nothing. You mind your own business!&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Tell me, no. Let me also know what it is.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What are you going to do, knowing it? You&rsquo;re going to give me ten rupees or what, saying &lsquo;here &rsquo;<em>pa</em>, don&rsquo;t struggle so much&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Oho&mdash;it&rsquo;s like that, is it? Why? It&rsquo;s only the tenth of the month! What &rsquo;<em>pa</em>, you started moaning already! I can&rsquo;t give five or ten. Just wait for two days! I&rsquo;ll start moaning along with you!&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Why? You give your newspapers every month, is it?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Oho, even that you finished doing, is it? You&rsquo;re a smart fellow!&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The peppered beaten rice wasn&rsquo;t good at all in the afternoon.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As usual, the office closed shop at six. The afternoon tiffin had burnt off in a trice, like grass in a forest flame, and my stomach was still on fire.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I walked, thinking of the clock-tower hotel. I was just about to enter the hotel when there was Dattoji standing in front of the betel-leaf shop, looking up at the clock&rsquo;s hand! There he was, moustache and all, dressed in a patched-up <em>dhoti</em>, when the world, full of cars, buses and pedestrians, whizzed past him southwards and northwards. He stood looking at the clock leisurely. What was the occasion to look at the clock? Or did he merely stand there marvelling at the extraordinary thing called a clock tower?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What, Rayarvaal?&rdquo; I called out. A slight surge of compassion poured out of my mind.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dattu turned around. Saw me. Widened his smile. &ldquo;Last-house <em>saar-aa</em>? <em>Namaskaram, saar</em>. Can&rsquo;t get your audience these days.&rdquo; He walked towards me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What, you&rsquo;ve come so far? And looking at the clock too! What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Just like that only I came. She asked me to come.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;My wife only. She&rsquo;s gone to the bioscope&mdash;the three o&rsquo;clock show. She&rsquo;ll come at six-fifteen, it seems. She asked if I could pick her up. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone to the cinema-<em>va</em>?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yes&mdash;in this theatre only.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you go?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Had money only for one ticket. That too she would have got it only by chance.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;But shouldn&rsquo;t you go along with her&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;No <em>saar</em>. Listen, I&rsquo;ll tell you. Early in the morning a woman brought jasmine from Reddypalayam. Rare to get jasmine in the month of Purattaasi, no? Immediately, my wife bought a heap. She gathered the flowers in the ends of the sari and went in. Didn&rsquo;t have any money. Will anyone return the flowers bought in the morning? She asked the neighbour. Didn&rsquo;t get anything. Then she took a pot, kept it in someone&rsquo;s house and came back with a rupee. The jasmine cost only ten annas. She had six annas remaining. &ldquo;What to do with it?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Some new film is coming today. Why don&rsquo;t you see it,&rdquo; I said. So she said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and she came. And now I must pick her up.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Shameless creatures!&rdquo; I wanted to shout out.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Shut your mouth, you insensitive creature,&rdquo; said a voice, grinding its teeth. I didn&rsquo;t turn around to see who it was. It was my voice only from deep within.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What a stupid brain,&rdquo; said the mind, tapping the cheeks in remorse.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Join me for coffee?&rdquo; I asked. Dattu came without hesitation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When I returned home the jasmine string on Gowri&rsquo;s hair cast a romantic spell. It seems Gangabai had given it saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought for you, <em>maami</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">No other jasmine in the world has the aroma of Reddypalayam jasmine. <em>Appa</em>!

But it was well-worth it as actors Mona Singh and Rohit Roy lit up the stage with their stupendous performance. Protagonists of the play &lsquo;Unfaithfully Yours&rsquo;, the duo kept the audience glued to their seats during the two-hour fairytale romance directed and produced by Raell Padamsee under the banner of Ace Productions.</strong><br /><br />Portraying the characters of Akash and Preet, the two are happily married but with a twist &mdash; not to each other. They meet at a friend&rsquo;s wedding where they engage in a one-night stand which blossoms into love. And that then is the beginning of a 26-year-long relationship packed with passion, romance, comedy and lots of drama.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The performance was held together by the flawless acting skills of Rohit and Mona who were at their natural best. Though the story revolves around an extra-marital affair, one can&rsquo;t help but fall in love with the tale, given the romance that blooms between Akash and Preet. <br /><br />There are wonderful moments of comedy cleverly woven in between which elicited much laughter from the audience. All the elements, including the drama quotient, were in equal measure and kept people engaged in the performance. The production, strictly meant for adults, received a standing ovation.<br /><br />Priti Agarwal, a viewer, said, &ldquo;It was a journey of a lifetime between two complete strangers, from lust to love and happiness. It was a well-written and acted out love saga of people coming from different worlds. Their pragmatic approach to life and completely ethereal connect was portrayed very realistically.&rdquo;&nbsp; <br /><br />As for the actors, it was their friendship off screen that translated into the sizzling chemistry on stage. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve worked with Rohit before as well. We&rsquo;ve done a short film together and hosted shows together and I get along really well with him. He called me up for the play and it sounded fabulous to me, given the romantic at heart that I am. When we started rehearsing, we thought this is the best thing we could do together. Now that we are travelling together and getting great reviews for the play, we want to do more shows,&rdquo; said Mona with a beaming smile.<br /><br />&ldquo;The biggest reason for doing this play is that I&rsquo;ve been wanting to do theatre for the longest time. I was approached by a lot of people to do theatre but nothing ever fell into place. When Raell came with this script, the first person that came to mind was Mona because of the degree of comfort we share and it worked out well. <br /><br />We are great friends off stage and that comfort translates into chemistry on stage,&rdquo; said Rohit. So does he believe in extra-marital affairs? &ldquo;Well, my wife doesnt let me!,&rdquo; said the handsome actor with a laugh. He was glad to know that the Bengaluru audience liked the play as he remarked, &ldquo;Well, I was apprehensive at first, there are so many intellectual, high-funda people here.&rdquo;</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/fairytale1475575056720.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf9a2ea63af2cd0d81d6b","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"mlr convention centre"},{"text":"whitefield"},{"text":"mona singh"},{"text":"rohit roy"},{"text":"unfaithfully yours"},{"text":"raell padamsee"},{"text":"ace productions"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/573854/a-fairytale-romance.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-04T09:57:54.752Z","udate":"2016-12-17T09:48:00.518Z","expirydate":"2017-10-04T09:57:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f37d22bf560c49baf483d5","publishedOn":"2016-10-04T10:09:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"priority":99999,"audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"mlr convention centre,whitefield,mona singh,rohit roy,unfaithfully yours,raell padamsee,ace productions","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Tactile feedback will allow us to use finer and more delicate sutures in microsurgery,\" he said.&nbsp;<br />Krishnan said the haptics technology would also improve the ability to distinguish between tissues involved with cancer from normal tissue.&nbsp;<br />The project's lead researcher Mohsen Moradi Dalvand, a visiting scholar at Harvard, said the haptic feedback improved safety and allowed specific manoeuvres and diagnoses to be performed with greater confidence.&nbsp;<br />\"HeroSurg's unique features which allow it to overcome many of the limitations of existing robotic laparoscopic systems, include collision avoidance capability, modularity and automatic patient/bed adjustment,\" Dalvand said.&nbsp;<br />\"The automatic collision avoidance enables surgeons to operate with peace of mind and confidence that there will be no collision with instruments, the robot's arms, or the laparoscope with the patient,\" he said.&nbsp;<br />Other unique HeroSurg features include high-resolution 3D images, an increased range of motion for the surgeon, and a more ergonomic workstation console.&nbsp;<br />\"HeroSurg will assist surgeons to perform demanding surgical procedures with comfort, accuracy and safety by providing real-time collision avoidance for medical instruments, and stereo-endoscopic vision,\" Dalvand said.&nbsp;<br />He added that the extra real-time 3D virtual HeroSurg would help the surgeon identify the position relationship of the instruments and laparoscope.&nbsp;<br />IISRI Director Professor Saeid Nahavandi said HeroSurg could be used remotely, with the surgeon potentially thousands of kilometres away from the actual theatre.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/Robotic_surgical_system1475570836838_(1)1475575646393.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","publisherSectionName":"siliconindiaNews","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"robotic surgeon"},{"text":"sense of touch"},{"text":"researchers"},{"text":"indian-origin"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://54.187.72.4:8080/#/search/World-First%20Robotic%20Surgeon%20With%20Sense%20Of%20Touch%20Created","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-04T10:07:40.342Z","udate":"2016-10-04T10:07:40.342Z","expirydate":"2017-10-04T10:07:40.342Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-04T10:07:27.000Z","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","publiseherSectionId":"57f37f6cbf560c49baf483fb","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f37f6cbf560c49baf483fa","priority":99999,"tagsForSearch":"robotic surgeon,sense of touch,researchers,indian-origin","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

There was tea tree to treat her acne; sandalwood and rose to give her 'that natural glow'; rosemary, peppermint and lavender to make lush her mane, the latter also entrusted to better her sleep. Ylang-ylang, rosewood, chamomile and tuberose were also peeking out of her bag, the elegant batch chosen for their reputation as destressers or emotional pacifiers. Her essential oil spree was a result of months of research, thanks to a passing recommendation by her spa-therapist friend.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>A world of goodness</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"http://static.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/2016/10/01/506416-thinkstockphotos-481105772.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So what are essential oils and why should one indulge? RashmiAmbastha, Spa Director, Four Seasons explains, \"These aromatic natural extracts are basically concentrated hydrophobic liquids that carry the goodness of whichever plant they have been extracted from\". Essential oils boost immunity, relieve pain, enhance skin and hair quality, improve emotional balance and blood circulation, as well as balance hormones...treating pretty much any health or beauty concern you can think of. \"They work their magic through inhalation, massages, fomentation, in bath water...\" Rashmi trails off. Luxe spas tap into the healing properties of these fragrant compounds that are sourcedlaboriously from different plant parts&mdash;seeds, barks, stems, roots, flowers and others&mdash;using them to attain a range of wellness goals.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Purva Devare, Spa Manager at all-Indian spa, Jiva, Taj Santacruz points out that essential oils are also popularly used as natural room fresheners, imparted through diffusers. Sandalwood and jasmine are two favourites, both grandly ranked in terms of properties and price. With a world of pleasurable goodness in their wake, it is natural that awareness about essential oils would resurface in modern times. Yet there are myths that need to be dismantled. Both Rashmi and Purva mull over the common misconception of essential oils being an element you can apply directly on your skin without dilution. \"That's lesson 1&mdash;this is not the kind of oil you lather yourself with in great quantities before bath,\" laughs Purva, stressing on the role of carrier or base oils like coconut, jojoba, avocado, olive or sweet almond. The dilution ratio varies with each purpose, but for gentle home aromatherapy, not more than two to three drops are usually required at a time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The price of pleasure</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"http://static.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/2016/10/01/506417-thinkstockphotos-482388539.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At Kama Ayurveda, a luxury holistic-wellness brand, patrons are partial towards pine, lemongrass and cypress essential oils, besides favourites like tea tree and peppermint, shares Shrishti Chaudhary, Assistant Manager, Marketing. The most expensive oil in stock is Lavender at ₹750 for a 12 ml bottle. Shrishti explains the steep cost by adding that the price surges when the oil is more concentrated or 'pure' in nature. It also depends on the plant or flower that the essence is from; the rarer the source, the higher the price. At Kama, which stocks only 13 essential oils, orange and eucalyptus come for ₹350 a bottle, while bergamot andylang-ylang are priced at ₹550. Most other places list neroli, champaca, sandalwood, rose, tuberose or frangipani as the most expensive ones they stock. At Moksha Lifestyle, an Indian essential oil manufacturer, a 30 ml bottle of rose (Damascena) essential oil costs a whopping ₹25, 518, while a tuberose absolute would leave your wallet lighter by ₹14, 369.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to essential oils, price is not the only vertical where the notion of luxury aligns itself. \"So many different experiences can be created out of essential oils, each rich and indulgent,\" says Purva, referring to the two contrasting essential oil-driven therapies of 'Vishram' (Repose) and 'Orjadayaka' (Energizer) at Jiva. 'Vishram', popular amongst visiting officials reeling under the exhaustion of a long journey, uses the common properties of lavender, brahmi, frankincense and rosewood to relax the body and mind. Orjadayaka, on the other hand, uses fennel, nagarmotha, ashwagandha and patchouli to relieve stress and spasms and boost immunity.\" Pointing out that the ingredients are purposely synchronised to conjure specific, varying sensations, Purva mentions that while many essential oils boast of similar properties and benefits, individuals tend to gravitate towards the scents that appeal to them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I remember the happy redolence of my friend's bottle of jasmine and nod along.

In the Booker Prize-winning The White Tiger (2008), it was &lsquo;India Unshining&rsquo;; in Last Man in Tower (2011), it was real estate; and now in Selection Day, he holds up the mirror to cricket, our national obsession. Adiga chooses to place the story in Mumbai, home to one of the richest cricket boards in the world, master batsman&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/tag/sachin-tendulkar/\">Sachin Tendulkar</a>, as well as the aspirations and dreams of an entire nation. He tells the story of 14-year-old Manjunath Kumar who is good at cricket&mdash;if not as good as his elder brother Radha.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Their dominating, cricket-crazy father, Mohan Kumar, who makes a living by selling chutneys out of a one-room tenement in a slum in Dahisar, has only one aim: his sons should make it to the Mumbai&mdash;and then Indian&mdash;cricket team. The brothers&rsquo; prayer to Subramanya, the 1,000-year-old god of cricket in their village in the Western Ghats, is: &ldquo;One of us should become the best batsman in the world, and the other second best.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The brothers, pushed by their obsessive father, land up in a Bandra school, far from their Dahisar room, thanks to cricket scholarships. Soon, they are spotted by NS Kulkarni, or Tommy Sir, a legendary cricket scout and journalist. After years in the service of cricket, Tommy Sir knows that the game in India no longer smells good. In fact, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Phixed and Ph&hellip;ed&rdquo;, and yet he devises a scheme to get the brothers out of their father&rsquo;s clutches and into a future team to become part of all this &ldquo;great nastiness&rdquo;. He teams up with venture capitalist Anand Mehta, who agrees to sponsor the brothers, but on one condition: he wants one-third of the boys&rsquo; future earnings.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a result, Manjunath, who is obsessed with science and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation reruns, is forced to work on his batting skills. Despite his primary interest being chemistry, he is good at the game and is soon part of record-breaking partnerships on the field. Anyone who follows cricket will immediately be reminded of Tendulkar and Vinod Kambli&rsquo;s 664-run partnership during their school days and the teenage sensation, Prithvi Shaw, who has been hauling up runs recently. Radha practises harder, working on his &ldquo;weight transfer issue&rdquo; while batting. He is out in the maidan even in rain, from 7.30-11 am and 3-5.30 pm, but will that be enough on selection day?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As success and failure are divided between the brothers, we can&rsquo;t help but ponder over the human cost of our aspirations. It&rsquo;s a common sight on every maidan and in every nook and corner of the country&mdash;boys aged five to 15 slug it out to become the next Tendulkar or <a href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/tag/virat-kohli/\">Virat Kohli</a>&mdash;but what happens when dreams are shattered? What happens to those who fail, because in this game, like any other sport, everyone knows that &ldquo;some boys fall&rdquo;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As Adiga looks into the human costs and the moral corruption around us, he delves into class, caste, families, religion and sexuality. The relationship between Manjunath and the dashing and affluent cricketer Javed, who gives it all up and wants Manjunath to do the same, is moving. The relationship between the brothers and their tyrannical father is one we are only too aware of from our daily newspapers. Away from the game, Manjunath is repressed and can do little about it. &ldquo;For himself, for his lies and cowardice, Manju had scorn&hellip; but he had much more scorn for a world that had never shown him a clear path to love or to security.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like Balram Halwai (The White Tiger) and Dharmen Shah (Last Man in Tower), there are some characters in Selection Day&mdash;Mohan Kumar, Anand Mehta and even Tommy Sir to an extent&mdash;whose vision of life is limited. It&rsquo;s as if they have no shame or guilt in running after whatever they are pursuing in this new social framework of greed and grab.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But unlike The White Tiger&mdash;for which there were whispers that Adiga&rsquo;s voice was sometimes inauthentic&mdash;little rings false in Selection Day. Yes, Mehta&rsquo;s satirical haranguing of the Indian way of life may be a bit too much&mdash;&ldquo;Indians are basically a sentimental race with high cholesterol levels&rdquo;&mdash;but what is an innings without a few daring shots? Adiga scores big with his third novel.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Sudipta Datta is a freelancer</em></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/unnamed1475576177008.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"sudipta datta"},{"text":"selection day"},{"text":"aravind adiga"},{"text":"harpercollins"},{"text":"sachin tendulkar"},{"text":"virat kohli"},{"text":"the white tiger"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd191afb61356b41a1bb48","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.financialexpress.com/industry/jobs/selection-day-by-aravind-adiga-book-review-holding-up-the-mirror-to-cricket/400947/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-04T10:16:22.238Z","udate":"2016-12-17T10:09:57.258Z","expirydate":"2017-10-04T10:16:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f38176b50ad45c76921ab6","publishedOn":"2016-10-04T10:17:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"priority":99999,"audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"sudipta datta,selection day,aravind adiga,harpercollins,sachin tendulkar,virat kohli,the white tiger","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Over the years, COPD has emerged as a growing epidemic all over the world. India is also experiencing a continued increase in the burden of COPD with an estimated prevalence of over 57 million.&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">COPD patients find it hard to breathe and being a progressive disease means that it gets worse over time. In this disease, less air flows in and out of the air passages in the body because of some particular reasons. Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) has proven to be an effective way to reduce respiratory distress in patients suffering with COPD. A study by The Lancet Respiratory Medicine states that NIV reduces the risk of death in chronic COPD patients by 76 per cent.&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The procedure provides ventilator assistance to lungs without an invasive artificial airway. It facilitates removal of excess carbon dioxide and improves oxygenation of the body by augmenting the patient&rsquo;s ventilation. NIV helps the patient breathe using a machine attached to a mask that is worn over the face. Usually, this mask is to be worn for a couple of hours in the morning and afternoon and at night for the entire time.&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr Nagaraj, Consultant, Pulmonogist, Paarthiv Lung Care Center, informs, \"NIV has revolutionised the management of COPD and it has proven to be most effective in dealing with exacerbations in COPD patients.

NIV has gained wide acceptance in the west as the frontline treatment for patients in moderate or advanced stages of COPD.&rdquo;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Indian Chest Society guidelines indicate early use of NIV in management of respiratory failure due to acute exacerbations of COPD.

As you delve into higher practices of Sanatan Kriya, these layers reveal themselves to you. The layer immediately next to the physical body is the Pranamaya, where prana (the force in creation) flows through a network of nadis and chakras. Of special significance is the Sushumna Nadi, on which all the major chakras in the body rest and through which prana flows from the base to higher centers.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Clairvoyantly, it is seen like glowing white tube at the center of body. Any congestion in this nadi causes stagnation of prana, breeding disease and old age.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The spine is a reflection of the Sushumna in the physical body and a kink in the spine is indicative of blockage in flow of prana in Sushumna.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let us, hence, move on in our series to strengthen the spine.

But what if someone isn't naturally mindful? Can they become so simply by trying to make mindfulness a \"state of mind\"? Or perhaps through a more focused, deliberate effort like meditation?</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The study, conducted in Jason Moser's Clinical Psychophysiology Lab, attempted to find out. Researchers assessed 68 participants for mindfulness using a scientifically validated survey. The participants were then randomly assigned to engage in an 18-minute audio guided meditation or listen to a control presentation of how to learn a new language, before viewing negative pictures (such as a bloody corpse) while their brain activity was recorded.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The participants who meditated, they had varying levels of natural mindfulness, showed similar levels of \"emotion regulatory\" brain activity as people with high levels of natural mindfulness.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In other words their emotional brains recovered quickly after viewing the troubling photos, essentially keeping their negative emotions in check. In addition, some of the participants were instructed to look at the gruesome photos \"mindfully\" while others received no such instruction. Interestingly, the people who viewed the photos \"mindfully\" showed no better ability to keep their negative emotions in check.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This suggests that for non-meditators, the emotional benefits of mindfulness might be better achieved through meditation, rather than \"forcing it\" as a state of mind, said Moser, co-author of the study.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"If you're a naturally mindful person, and you're walking around very aware of things, you're good to go. You shed your emotions quickly,\" Moser said. \"If you're not naturally mindful, then meditating can make you look like a person who walks around with a lot of mindfulness. But for people who are not naturally mindful and have never meditated, forcing oneself to be mindful 'in the moment' doesn't work. You'd be better off meditating for 20 minutes.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The study has been published in the journal <em>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience</em>.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/meditation1475580579285.jpeg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baab806a12cf7ee39133b8","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"meditation"},{"text":"neuroscience"},{"text":"mindfulness"},{"text":"michigan state university"},{"text":"psychology"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/health-and-wellbeing/041016/meditation-may-be-helpful-in-taming-our-emotions.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":true,"cdate":"2016-10-04T11:29:57.402Z","udate":"2016-10-04T12:15:21.512Z","expirydate":"2017-10-04T11:29:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f392b5b50ad45c76921bb1","publishedOn":"2016-10-04T12:15:05.000Z","publishedBy":"57dd191afb61356b41a1bb48","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"priority":99999,"tagsForSearch":"meditation,neuroscience,mindfulness,michigan state university,psychology","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

By the restless energy with which he threw himself into the many different genres of creation whether it be painting, sculpting, mural art, installations and writing on art, he reminds us of the myth of Sisyphus. At the start of a new day of creation, Arakkal would be ready with a new series and carry it up the mountain. When he reached the summit, his only thought was how to start again.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I think the artist today has to be something of a performer,&rdquo; he confesses, &ldquo;Picasso was a great performer, though he was also the greatest artist of his time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">That was how Arakkal liked to measure himself. Against the greatest artists of his time and those that had come before him. It explains why in many of his works there are references to the works of the greats as he liked to call them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>A thrilling moment</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of his most thrilling moments was when he was awarded the Lorenzo il Magnifico Prize at the Florence International Biennale of Contemporary Art on 6th Dec. 2003.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is how he described it soon afterwards:&ldquo;My work, entitled, &ldquo;War, Guernica Reoccurs&rdquo; was one of the largest canvases in the show and was given a very central place in the display,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but with all those works around I never had any hope of winning the award. There was a dinner concert on the last day. We returned in time for that and just as I was walking into the pavilion, I heard my name being announced as the second prize winner: The Lorenzo il Magnifico silver medal. I could not believe it! In my acceptance speech I said it was an award for my country and that I was elated to win an award in the city of Michaelangelo.&rdquo;</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was a long journey for Arakkal, the rebellious son of a royal family of Kannur in Malabar who fled to Bengaluru working at many menial jobs before he found himself a place at the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). While he was welding pieces of metal together, he was also forging his place as an artist in the heady atmosphere of the city of endless delights that was Bengaluru in its heyday. Even before he had finished his apprenticeship as an artist at the Chitrakala Parishath College at Bengaluru and a stint at Garhi studios, Delhi as a print-maker, Arakkal was holding the first of his many one-man shows, attending every artist camp to which he was invited and making a place for himself in the tumult of the artist&rsquo;s world.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>A soaring imagination</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">His mind and his imagination soared just like the kites in the paintings of the 1980s and 1990s. They float in a riot of coloured panels soldered together by the restless brush marks, or indentations of his palette knife. He often worked in a series. It could be a kite, a crow, a solitary bed, an old man staring out of a window with bars, a chair, orange robed monks, women of Benaras in white, Egyptian symbols, not to mention his &lsquo;quotations&rsquo; from famous works of art. Like the pirates of Malabar he plundered the treasures of the world and made them his.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As his close cousin and confidante A. M.

It&rsquo;s not our &lsquo;right&rsquo; to know her,&rdquo; she wrote.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Italian novelist Erri de Luca agreed. &ldquo;To whom does it matter a jot the real identity of Elena Ferrante?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As a reader the identity of a writer is of no interest to me.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Novelist Matt Haig added: &ldquo;Think the pursuit to discover the &lsquo;real&rsquo; Elena Ferrante is a disgrace and also pointless,&rdquo; he tweeted. &ldquo;A writer&rsquo;s truest self is the books they write.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Being economical with biographical details is not exactly unprecedented in literary history.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ferrante herself revealed in a 2003 interview that she liked her compatriot Italo Calvino&rsquo;s warning to a student of his work: &ldquo;Ask me what you want to know, but I won&rsquo;t tell you the truth, of that you can be sure.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The writer&rsquo;s unmasking will inevitably reignite speculation that Raja&rsquo;s husband, Domenico Starnone, a Neapolitan who has also written about the city&rsquo;s post-war period, may have had a hand in the Ferrante books.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A decade ago, experts at Rome&rsquo;s La Sapienza University employed text analysis software to try and establish who Ferrante might be.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">They concluded there was a &ldquo;high probability&rdquo; Starnone had written them.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Several other literary figures were linked to the books in the intervening years but no one had, until now, produced the kind of back-up evidence Gatti has acquired.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/elena1475582071297.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babcefb210157e920b07f9","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"literature"},{"text":"mysteries"},{"text":"italian publishing sensation"},{"text":"elena ferrante"},{"text":"literary"},{"text":"journalistic ethics"},{"text":"writers’ right"},{"text":"claudio gatti"},{"text":"italian investigative journalist"},{"text":"anita raja"},{"text":"novelist"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/elena-ferrante-unmasking-triggers-writers-privacy-row/article9183957.ece","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-04T11:54:49.787Z","udate":"2016-12-17T10:10:37.615Z","expirydate":"2017-10-04T11:54:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f398897af2a049d524c668","publishedOn":"2016-10-04T12:18:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"priority":99999,"audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"literature,mysteries,italian publishing sensation,elena ferrante,literary,journalistic ethics,writers’ right,claudio gatti,italian investigative journalist,anita raja,novelist","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

People with diabetes have high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Diabetes is a disorder of metabolism, the way the body uses digested food for energy. The digestive tract breaks down carbohydrates, sugars and starches found in many foods, into glucose, a form of sugar that enters the bloodstream. Diabetes develops when the body doesn't make enough insulin or is not able to use insulin effectively, or both.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The two main types of diabetes are</strong>:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Type 1 Diabetes</strong>: Type 1 diabetes typically occurs in children and young adults, though it can appear at any age. In the past, type 1 diabetes was called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Heredity plays an important part in determining who is likely to develop type 1 diabetes. Genes are passed down from biological parent to child.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Type 2 Diabetes</strong>: Type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people who are also overweight or obese. The disease, once rare in youth, is becoming more common in overweight and obese children and adolescents. Type 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of factors, including insulin resistance, a condition in which the body's muscle, fat, and liver cells do not use insulin effectively.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Physical Inactivity, Obesity, and Diabetes</strong>:&nbsp;Physical inactivity and obesity are strongly associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. People who are genetically susceptible to type 2 diabetes are more vulnerable when these risk factors are present. About 80 percent of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An imbalance between caloric intake and physical activity can lead to obesity, which causes insulin resistance and is common in people with type 2 diabetes. Central obesity, in which a person has excess abdominal fat, is a major risk factor not only for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes but also for heart and blood vessel disease, also called cardiovascular disease (CVD). This excess belly fat produces hormones and other substances that can cause harmful, chronic effects in the body such as damage to blood vessels.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, measuring your waist is a quick way of assessing your diabetes risk. This is a measure of abdominal obesity, which is a particularly high-risk form of obesity. Women have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if their waist measures 80cm (31.5 inches) or more. Asian men with a waist size of 89cm (35 inches) or more have a higher risk, as do white or black men with a waist size of 94cm (37 inches) or more.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Simple Steps to Lower Your Risk</strong>:&nbsp;Making a few lifestyle changes can dramatically lower the chances of developing type 2 diabetes. The same changes can also lower the chances of developing heart disease and other life taking cancers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1.<strong> Control Your Weight</strong>:&nbsp;Being overweight increases the chances of developing type 2 diabetes seven-fold. Being obese makes you 20 to 40 times more likely to develop diabetes than someone with a healthy weight. Losing weight can help if your weight is above the healthy-weight range. Check your BMI. Losing 7 to 10 percent of your current weight can cut your chances of developing type 2 diabetes in half.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. <strong>Get Moving and Turn Off the Television</strong>:&nbsp;Inactivity promotes type 2 diabetes. Working your muscles more often and making them work harder improves their ability to use insulin and absorb glucose. This puts less stress on your insulin-making cells.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. <strong>Tune Up Your Diet</strong>:&nbsp;Four dietary changes can have a big impact on the risk of type 2 diabetes-</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Choose whole grains and whole grain products over highly processed carbohydrates.</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Skip the sugary drinks, and choose water, coffee, or tea instead.</li>\n<li>Choose good fats instead of bad fats.</li>\n<li>Limit red meat and avoid processed meat; choose nuts, whole grains, poultry, or fish instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are already suffering from diabetes, then do take a walk everyday and adopt healthy eating habits. Along with that relieve your stress and take proper doses of insulin or medications as prescribed by your doctor.</p>\n</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/obesity1475583097094.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"579363ed4c0ab56541be1c26","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"obesity"},{"text":"diabetes"},{"text":"type 2 diabetes"},{"text":"physical inactivity"},{"text":"type 1 diabetes"},{"text":"weight"},{"text":"diet"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"https://www.lybrate.com/topic/obesity-and-diabetes-f1f3/a065c1eb41a3ca90f0f5489356c33701","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":true,"cdate":"2016-10-04T12:11:55.543Z","udate":"2016-10-04T12:15:53.237Z","expirydate":"2017-10-04T12:11:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f39c8b9657dc5c5b9dd073","publishedOn":"2016-10-04T12:15:39.000Z","publishedBy":"57dd191afb61356b41a1bb48","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"priority":99999,"tagsForSearch":"obesity,diabetes,type 2 diabetes,physical inactivity,type 1 diabetes,weight,diet","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57f39d62bf560c49baf4856f","title":"How Important Is Facial for Your Skin?","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e65af76df6bbfd6adf3","content":"<div class=\"md-body-1 lybMar-top lybDarkGrey richText-Content ng-binding ng-scope\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It's a fact that skin is the largest organ. On the top of it, it's exposed to the outer world experiencing all possible conditions. Is it not good enough reason to answer the question whether facial is a treat or necessary for healthy skin.&nbsp;It is vital to take extra care of your skin for its good health. A periodic facial keeps the skin healthy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Benefits of Facials</strong><br />Facials help in rejuvenation of skin, and help in removing wear and tear. These are important to keep skin texture young, hydrated and plump.<br />Elasticity and collagen are built over time.&nbsp;Other important benefits are improvement of scarring, wrinkles and crinkles and also reduction in hyperpigmentation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Mechanism of Facials</strong><br />Dead skin cells make you skin look dull. Besides, other problems are blackheads and whiteheads, known as comedones, and blocked pores. This leads to slow down in elasticity and collagen productions.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Steps involved in Facial:</strong></p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Clean up</li>\n<li>Exfoliation to remove congestion and exposure of comedones to be extracted easily</li>\n<li>Application of therapeutic products for complexion balancing. For beginners, this process is multi-layered.</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Beginners can go for facial once in every 4 to 6 weeks.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Types of exfoliation:&nbsp;</strong><br /><strong>Two broad types of facials are available</strong>: Physical and Chemical. Physical facials normally include microdermabrasion. Chemical ones have a peeling agent. The alternate use results in better skin tone with less crinkles or wrinkles. It also helps in making pores smaller and tighter. Pigmentation and sun or age spots lighten.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Different skin types have different problems. It is an efficient dermatologist who would understand your problem to provide appropriate solutions. Facial for a dull skin may differ from that of an acne prone or clogged pores related skin facial. Besides, people with sensitive skin or redness on the skin have altogether different struggle and remedy. The use of Clarisonic brush gives an idea about the sensitivity level of a skin. Regular use of this brush results in fewer blackheads and clogged pores as Clarisonic brush has an ability to cleanse skin 11 times more than cleaning with hands.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Facials are one of the apt ways to cleanse and revitalize your skin quickly. They also help in restoring the mind and body. If you have time, you can also go for a home facial, following simple instructions and steps, and with good products available in the market. Use a magnifying mirror to have a view of comedones and extract them. Finish it with a toner, moisturiser and sunscreen.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Remember that healthy skin can make you look beautiful and confident. So, why delay?

In the court of public opinion, the easily offended and humourless convict you of thought crimes. One becomes guilty of what the accuser is projecting onto the act and/or situation.

Triggered. Racist. Homophobic. Sexist.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Where these terms used to be reserved for the most despicable because acts of bigotry, sexism, racism, homophobia, are horrible and should be condemned unconditionally, these terms and their cousins are bandied willy-nilly without as much as the slightest sense of irony.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because, especially in the creative arts, and in fiction, when barriers such as these, barriers that don&rsquo;t really mean anything, are erected, one quickly gets pushed into territories of authoritarianism and censorship. And I would not be off the mark if I were to make the blasphemous claim that no writer of any worth wants anything to do with it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What&rsquo;s the difference between the Ayatollah issuing a fatwa against Salman Rushdie for writing a novel, and Jenny from Chelsea who accuses Marko, a first-time novelist, of usurping the experiences of a Caribbean transgender who identifies as a Japanese businessman because Marko&rsquo;s protagonist is Henry Powell, a 6&rsquo;2 Caribbean transgender who walks around in immaculate business suits, and elongates his eye-liner to mimic slanted eyes and only answers when called Hirosito Mugami?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, for the record, the latter example does not exist. Or maybe it does. Maybe somewhere there&rsquo;s a writer named Marko who&rsquo;s writing a Caribbean-transgender-identifying-as-a-Japanese-businessman character as we speak.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I just made it up, and right there is the foundation on which all of fiction stands.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Right there is what Shriver was trying to convey.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So what exactly is cultural appropriation?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Do I, a cisgender, heterosexual male from a minority community in the Northeast of India appropriate Anglo-Saxon culture when I&rsquo;m influenced by Hemingway, when there are snippets of Mark Twain in my writing?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What if I decide that my piece of fiction would be incomplete without a shy Kokanastha-Brahmin lawyer who has his first homosexual experience with a flashy sports-agent Sardar?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Should I stop rapping along to rap music because the black American-in-the-ghetto experience has nothing to do with mine?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In light of such ridiculousness, especially in the past couple of years, Shriver&rsquo;s speech has been such an eye-opener because it takes on the issues of political correctness, cultural appropriation, and racism head on. Yes, racism exists. Yes, political correctness, in the correct environment can be a positive thing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But you remove the power of these words and labels, when anything under the sun can be labeled politically incorrect, anyone with a different opinion of the other is called racist.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In her speech, Shriver spoke about Susan Scafidi, law professor at Fordham University and the author of <em>Who Owns Culture? Appropriation and Authenticity in American Law</em>. Shriver stated that Scafidi defines cultural appropriation as &ldquo;taking intellectual property, traditional knowledge, cultural expressions, or artifacts from someone else&rsquo;s culture without permission. This can include unauthorised use of another culture&rsquo;s dance, dress, music, language, folklore, cuisine, traditional medicine, religious symbols, etc.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shriver rejects this definition and I do, too. Fiction is difficult and it is a result of attempts to make sense of the world around us, the world as we see and understand. A world where dances, dresses, music, language, folklore, cuisine, medicine, religious symbols are all tangled up. Mixed up and diverse. Borrowed and adopted and adapted.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because human civilization has always been about that, and no amount of this far-left, meaningless progressivism that we see seeping into all facets of art, music, politics, and literature, can ever change that.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">-<span style=\"color: #000000;\">&nbsp;<a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http://www.firstpost.com/author/babatdor-dkhar\" rel=\"author\">Babatdor Dkhar</a></span></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/lionel1475584234944.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57bab8bdecbc9256e95c1836","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"fiction and identity politics"},{"text":"cultural appropriation"},{"text":"fweekend"},{"text":"jk rowling"},{"text":"lionel shriver"},{"text":"political correctness"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.firstpost.com/living/we-need-to-talk-about-cultural-appropriation-why-i-agree-with-lionel-shriver-3027904.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-04T12:30:53.990Z","udate":"2016-12-17T10:48:11.148Z","expirydate":"2017-10-04T12:30:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f3a0fd7af2a049d524c6d3","publishedOn":"2016-10-04T12:53:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"priority":99999,"audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"fiction and identity politics,cultural appropriation,fweekend,jk rowling,lionel shriver,political correctness","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57f3a3679657dc5c5b9dd0bf","title":"If Kasturba Gandhi kept a secret diary, would it be anything like this new book on her?","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fde34a4ac2d218b1a5c","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Neelima Adhaar has written a fictional account of India&rsquo;s 'first first lady', the wife of the Father of the Nation, Kasturba Gandhi, in what is the subversive equivalent of flipping the chalkboard to read the other side. She talks here about her inspiration and how she got into Kasturba&rsquo;s mind, her life in the shadow of the country&rsquo;s first citizen and her relationship with her sons.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What gave you the idea for the book? How did you narrow down on its structure, of how you would want to go about it?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>&nbsp;</em>I wanted to write about of a strong woman character set in the era of pre/post-Independence. Kastur (as suggested by Namita Gokhale) fitted the bill to some degree. The book actually evolved after two years of extensive research and internal churning that led me to give the elusive shadow-wife of the Mahatma, a voice and structure. And the more she came alive in my mindscape, the more I began to tune-in to the deliberations of a forgotten woman, whose story needed to be heard. So rather than give it the shape of a boring linear narrative that chronicled her life, of which there is little information and a whole lot of mis-information, I made that quantum leap into the unknown to create this portraiture, in the form of her diary.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Describe your research for us. There isn&rsquo;t much that has been documented about Kasturba&rsquo;s life. How does a writer then enter her mind?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As you rightly said, there is hardly anything substantial written about Kastur, so I had to rely heavily on Gandhi&rsquo;s autobiography &lsquo;<em>My Experiments With Truth&rsquo;</em> in which I found &nbsp;enough material to ready a blue print of her life. And since Gandhi firmly believed and propagated that anything that is not secret, is not a sin, his candid confessions helped me form the outline of my portraiture of her. Also, Arun and Sunanda Gandhi&rsquo;s biography <em>The Forgotten Woman</em> on their grandmother, although in my opinion essentially hagiographic in content, did provide me with a whole range of data that I used for my characterisation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Being a passionate &lsquo;people watcher&rsquo; and a student of Psychology, I found it thrilling to enter Kastur&rsquo;s mind; to live, feel, emote, breathe, cry, laugh, scream and then curl up and die, with my protagonist; to sculpt her and perhaps immortalise her in those 390 odd pages.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>When you are writing fiction born out of history, is there a dilemma, as in which to lead with? Do you stick to a lot of the history, which may limit your imagination or just reinvent the bottom line?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Indeed, history is not to be tampered with and I did not.All historical dates, events and facts are accurate in the book. With the available apparatus, my creative license has allowed me to craft a multi-dimensional being as the character began to evolve in my mind. So let&rsquo;s just say I never wrote or rewrote history, I just played the spaces between.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>We know little of Kasturba&rsquo;s life. What is then lost when we fail to see history through the eyes of our women? Just how many other women do we know of, who are missing for no fault of theirs, as part of the success stories most men write (or we would have had a mother of the nation as well)?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I don&rsquo;t know if I want to say that. Every mother is the omniscient Mother of the cosmos who is far more grandiose than just &lsquo;Mother of a nation&rsquo;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My Kasturba is not aspiring to find a place in the hallowed hall of fame that her husband inhabits. She merely attempts to &lsquo;humanise&rsquo; him and earn her &lsquo;slice of the sky&rsquo; denied to her by providence and the conquerors who wrote history. However, the need to illumine those scores of women who have outshone their male counterparts in every space of the universe, and earned their places in the highest echelons of those supernova brigades, endures.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But for me, Kasturba is the quintessential Indian woman, who transcends time; the tender loving mother, the devoted wife of an extraordinary man, the ferocious protector of all she holds sacred the eternal feminine Shakti that was never created, nor can ever be destroyed.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3029888\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://s1.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Kasturba-Gandhi-Getty-Images-825.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3029888\" src=\"http://s1.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Kasturba-Gandhi-Getty-Images-825.jpg\" alt=\"(GERMANY OUT) Kasturba Gandhi*11.04.1869 - 22.02.1942+Ehefrau von Mahatma GandhiPortrait- 1915 (Photo by R&uuml;he/ullstein bild via Getty Images)\" width=\"825\" height=\"586\" data-original=\"http://s1.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Kasturba-Gandhi-Getty-Images-825.jpg\" /></a>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kasturba Gandhi. Via Getty Images</p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How have you handled the personal aspects of the couple&rsquo;s life? Much has been said, some of it not too long ago, by parties and politicians about the sexuality and personal life of Gandhi. Is it at all easy to put that narrative line in a safe cask that we may enjoy over, say a weekend?&nbsp; And in doing so are we simply escaping? What would you rather do?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have never shied away from candid descriptions of close encounters between men and women; my two earlier books bear ample testimony to that. The treatment of the utterly beautiful and natural sexual exchange that is wired into the genetics of all living species features quite liberally in my writings. In Kastur&rsquo;s diary the handling is no different. For me, both Gandhi (who by his own admission was driven by a heightened libido or the desperate need to suppress it) and Kastur, are primarily human, and I don&rsquo;t feel the need to couch it in a &lsquo;safe cask&rsquo;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The word Gandhi has become synonymous with India in itself. Is then therefore a need to, sort of, separate the history from the man, so we can come to accept things about him, our textbooks won&rsquo;t allow our conscience to? Do you think that is where fiction can help us?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yes indeed. Gandhi evokes India and vice-versa. But despite the great debate about liberty and freedom of speech that has now assumed huge proportions in our country we must not forget that this has been our age-old tradition, long before other civilisations took root. We argue and debate freely; even our Gods do! So, no one is wholly untainted or downright evil. It is just our own perspective.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And this book is not the story of the Mahatma, whom we all deeply revere; it is the story of Kastur.&nbsp; It is her subjective narration. In the pages of her imaginary diary, she often feels hemmed in, even as she whole-heartedly participates in his mission, as the gentle prophet of peace.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Does the book touch upon the often-contested facts about the relationship between Gandhi and Sarala Devi and how it may or may not have affected Kasturba?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Sarala Devi episode, which I have touched upon in the diary, did have a poignant effect on Kastur. Much as she was accustomed to her husband&rsquo;s numerous relationships with both men and women &mdash;&nbsp;not necessarily sexual &mdash;&nbsp;she did feel completely cordoned off here. Sarala Devi did manage to unnerve the normally tolerant woman in Kastur, but she handled it with so much panache that their equanimity was soon restored and life carried on like before.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How did you see Kasturba&rsquo;s role as a mother and her relationship with her troubled son Harilal? Would she have at some point seen binary opposites in her husband and son? What does that do to a woman?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Perhaps the most heart-wrenching challenge for Kastur, the mother, was maintaining the balance between a wayward son and a tyrannical father. She blamed Gandhi (and herself by default) for the plight of Harilal and to some extent the other three boys for which she could do nothing but rant and cry. To deal with such searing bipolar currents every waking moment of the day is nothing short of an internal nuclear fission. You are bound to self-combust. A tough call for the sturdiest of humans, what to talk of a mother!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>You would be well aware that the book might court controversy quite easily. What do you think is the problem there and how do you plan to handle it?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is a work of fiction, as is clearly stated on the copyright page and I don&rsquo;t see why there should be any controversy. My Kastur is a fictional character bound within the domain of documented history. She may speak and behave in a manner that may appear out of place, but let us not forget that this is how I have chosen to paint her, through the realm of my imagination.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My Kastur lives and breathes and speaks and emotes and traipses effortlessly through this chronicle as perhaps I would if I were her. And I would want everyone, particularly &lsquo;young India&rsquo; and the youth of the rest of the world, to invade that space with me, and re-live the saga of this phenomenal woman who for me, transcends every limitation and resurrects herself in the pages of her diary.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>'The Secret Diary of Kasturba' is published by Westland</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>-&nbsp;<a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http://www.firstpost.com/author/manik-sharma\" rel=\"author\">Manik Sharma</a></em></span></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/neelima1475584852054.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57bab8bdecbc9256e95c1836","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"historical fiction"},{"text":"kasturba gandhi"},{"text":"mahatma gandhi"},{"text":"mohandas karamchand gandhi"},{"text":"neelima adhaar"},{"text":"the secret diary of kasturba"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.firstpost.com/living/if-kasturba-gandhi-kept-a-secret-diary-would-it-be-anything-like-this-new-book-on-her-3026818.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-04T12:41:11.738Z","udate":"2016-12-17T10:55:11.230Z","expirydate":"2017-10-04T12:41:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f3a3679657dc5c5b9dd0c1","publishedOn":"2016-10-04T12:53:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"priority":99999,"audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"historical fiction,kasturba gandhi,mahatma gandhi,mohandas karamchand gandhi,neelima adhaar,the secret diary of kasturba","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57f3a52f7d07cc5caca7485d","title":"Gurdial Singh's Alms In The Name Of A Blind Horse is most certainly a novel of 'two reads'","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fa234a4ac2d218b1a52","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Indian pastoral is a text within which the corruption of milieu is often the aggregating function that brings macro-narratives together. These narratives, uni-polar on the human side, seek to emote and deconstruct with an apparatus that leaves little or no space to fit in the micro-narrative. That the reader expects larger-than-life characters coming out of rural chic, thereby anchorage that appeals mostly to our cosmopolitan sensibilities, is instructive on how reading has developed over the years in the country. There are not many books out there that can capture rural India, in all its slow, earthly materiality and perhaps there aren&rsquo;t enough writers who have lived it, to write from within context either. Gurdial Singh&rsquo;s <em>Anhey Ghore Da Daan</em>&nbsp;(1976), now translated by Rana Nayar as <em>Alms in the Name of a Blind Horse</em> is perhaps, more an indicator than an exception to that rule, if a large enough oeuvre exists to create one.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Singh&rsquo;s strengths are found in what he refuses to describe for us. <em>Alms in the Name of a Blind&nbsp; Horse</em> is not so much a narrative as it a quadrant approach to telling the story of a village the finality of which is squeezed into a single day. The focus shifts from family to family, and character to character as the inner billings of a village on the verge of being gulped by industrialists has begun to take its toll within, and despite the inhabitants. Singh&rsquo;s prose and his technique in which he completely forgoes the labour of description is extremely effective. Even more so if one has, even for a fleeting moment, witnessed a cold morning in rural Punjab, where the novel is set. There is, however, difficulty in following the book as it meanders between characters, who in the entirety of the book, dissolve into each other to often give the impression of the same person speaking every other time. There is no narrative thread to follow, sans the indicator at the beginning of the book that sets the events of the day in motion. The events themselves are ruminative, rather than consequential to any degree. And therein, perhaps, lies the point.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though every novel, aspirational in one way or the other, seeks to develop a relationship with the reader, Singh&rsquo;s genre-turning intervention is the detour from that approach. At times the book can become a frustrating read for its lack of acerbic wit, or forthrightness that though present lacks the charm of quotable ideas. For that copious abstinence Singh is perhaps the conductor than he is the unwilling quotient. The truth about character and of a character is more of a hegemonic approach to writing text than it is to being true to the text. Singh&rsquo;s approach of moving through quadrants of mini-events where characters act as coordinates for pausing in time and space is efficient for the setting the book seeks to invoke. As we move through the book the consummate dejection is conveyed through the myriad exchanges that many characters have but not to the extent that it may leap out at the reader. A villager&rsquo;s house is being demolished, and though illegal in its existence, the incumbent family has no place left to go. The men, mostly seniors, in the village gather and go from one spot to the other seeking solution or redemption of some sort. Equally straining is the plight of rickshaw riders who are struggling to cope with battery operated rickshaws that are now plying their trade in the nearby town. You gather more than you pick these things as you go on reading.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is absolutely little to no detailing of the image, except for markers that we may most identify with: expanses of green fields under blue skies and <em>charpai</em> (manji) conversations over tea. It is winter, and the cold marginalises movement and action. Singh captures it beautifully, by choosing to say nothing about it. Not until the latter half of the book, when Dharma&rsquo;s house is nearly demolished, and the village folk, resigned to their fate, sort of make peace with destiny do the first few passages of descriptive writing appear, an incremental approach to writing that works more as a visual medium. What is the catharsis or the end then? Well, look around. For that is how minimalistic the book can be, which also makes it difficult to follow at times. It is most certainly a novel of two-reads, the second time being the more corporeal evaluation, free in its knowledge of a day, which ensembles into the flesh of night, with the sense of a horse (perhaps us), blind to the unbecoming of a grain of wheat.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Film</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3028962\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://s1.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/anhey-gore-da-daan.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3028962\" src=\"http://s1.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/anhey-gore-da-daan.jpg\" alt=\"A still from Gurvinder Singh's 'Anhey Ghore Da Daan'\" width=\"825\" height=\"531\" data-original=\"http://s1.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/anhey-gore-da-daan.jpg\" /></a>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A still from Gurvinder Singh's 'Anhey Ghore Da Daan'</p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is only natural to talk about Gurvinder Singh&rsquo;s film <em>Anhey Ghore Da Daan</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>(2011)</em> that was based on the novel. As said so aptly by Rana Nayar in the introduction to the book, a film invents its own discourse rather than merely accentuating the book it might be based on. Since the mediums are different, and so is the language it is best to approach both as independent texts, which may or may not borrow from each other. Singh shot into limelight only lately with his second feature <em>Chauthi Koot (2015) </em>which is also based on a Punjabi writer in Waryam Singh Sandhu. Gurvinder, clearly flourishes with the advantage of the visual and more than re-accounts or retells the events of the day, as he imagines them to be.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though the characters remain the same, and so do the conspiring events, there is a Tarkovsky-ian feel to the film. The slow procession of the camera, the methodising of actors who are not really actors and the study of their faces cringing from cold and circumstance at the same time is laudable. Perhaps the greatest credit to Singh&rsquo;s direction, as with the author&rsquo;s writing is the utter refusal to plunge his frames into the meadow-y gloss of the countryside lit by a parked sun unsmilingly acting as a coefficient of the rivers that now no longer flow. This after all, is not a Yash Raj film and neither similar to the patriarchal, civil transactions (<em>Jatt and Juliet for example</em>) that we have come to identify of Punjabi cinema.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gurvinder, therefore, accomplishes a lot more, and is perhaps, better placed to do so in the film. That in itself is an appreciation of a text capable of levitating above the chains of medium and thought. That said, the film, like the book can be an even more difficult watch what with its cache of the visual, unflinchingly restrained and reserved. We, who are intoned to the aesthetic of Bollywood might find that unacceptable and even ordinary. But so is rural and real life. There are no heroes. Gurvinder though innovates where most directors wouldn&rsquo;t and risks what most directors won&rsquo;t, in creating a film that is in all likelihood the birth of a career that will travel inwards, towards the conscience of our untold landscapes, as it evidently, should.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/gurdial_singh1475585309873.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57bab8bdecbc9256e95c1836","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"alms in the name of a blind horse"},{"text":"anhey ghorey da daan"},{"text":"book review"},{"text":"books"},{"text":"films"},{"text":"gurdial singh"},{"text":"rana nayar"},{"text":"sahitya akademi"},{"text":"translation"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.firstpost.com/living/gurdial-singhs-alms-in-the-name-of-a-blind-horse-is-a-most-certainly-a-novel-of-two-reads-3028870.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-04T12:48:47.971Z","udate":"2016-12-17T09:52:12.045Z","expirydate":"2017-10-04T12:48:00.000Z","title_or_id":"","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f3a52f7d07cc5caca7485f","publishedOn":"2016-10-04T12:53:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"priority":99999,"audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"alms in the name of a blind horse,anhey ghorey da daan,book review,books,films,gurdial singh,rana nayar,sahitya akademi,translation","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Pyridoxine-doxylamine (Diclectin) and ondansetron (Zofran) both beat a placebo for moderate symptoms.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When women have moderate to severe symptoms, they may get better results by taking pyridoxine-doxylamine preemptively to reduce the risk of recurrent vomiting instead of waiting to take this medicine until symptoms return, one study of 60 women in the analysis suggests.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another study found ondansetron more effective at curbing moderate to severe nausea in the first few days of use than metoclopramide, but no difference in how many times women vomited.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With hyperemesis gravidarum, women have fewer options and there&rsquo;s even less evidence, the study authors note.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Corticosteroids appeared superior to metoclopramide for reducing vomiting episodes in an analysis of three studies of women with the most severe symptoms. One limitation of the analysis is that researchers lacked data to compare side effects for babies associated with different treatments the authors note.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The findings aren&rsquo;t surprising because ethics limit testing experimental drugs in pregnancy, particularly during the early months when medications might harm fetal development, said Angela Lupattelli, a pharmacy researcher at the University of Oslo in Norway who wasn&rsquo;t involved in the study.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Complicating matters, there aren&rsquo;t good objective tests to assess nausea symptoms, Lupattelli added by email. &ldquo;In case of mild symptoms, women are recommended to change their dietary habits first, and then try non-pharmacological options,&rdquo; Lupattelli said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some women do well with small, frequent meals that are high in protein and avoiding strong odors or other identifiable triggers for nausea, while others respond well to ginger, said Dr. Siripanth Nippita, a researcher at Harvard University in Boston who wasn&rsquo;t involved in the study.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Other women may need medication,&rdquo; Nippita added by email. &ldquo;Pregnant women should let their obstetricians know early on how nausea and vomiting are affecting them, so they can get the help they need.&rdquo;</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/remedies1475653955732.jpeg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baab806a12cf7ee39133b8","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"pregnancy"},{"text":"morning sickness"},{"text":"dehydration"},{"text":"women"},{"text":"nausea"},{"text":"vomiting"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/health-and-wellbeing/051016/still-unclear-which-remedies-are-best-for-morning-sickness.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":true,"cdate":"2016-10-05T07:52:53.993Z","udate":"2016-10-05T08:01:59.111Z","expirydate":"2017-10-05T07:52:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f4b15686df30096d04ac80","publishedOn":"2016-10-05T08:01:29.000Z","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"priority":99999,"tagsForSearch":"pregnancy,morning sickness,dehydration,women,nausea,vomiting","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Oshumi, during his research &ndash;the result of which was published in 1992, cultured altered yeast, lacking vacuolar degradation enzymes and simultaneously stimulated autophagy by starving the cells. Within hours, the yeast sacks were filled with small vesicles that had not been degraded. The sacks were basically cells undergoing autophagy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Oshumi, therefore found a method to identify and characterise key genes involved in this process. His research findings, for which he won a Nobel prize, have generated much interest in the science behind the biological process.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&ldquo;As with a tow truck carrying cargo waste to the dump yard, the cell uses special structures called autophagosomes to carry large cellular wastes to the lysosomes for degradation by a process of autophagosis, which literally translates to &lsquo;eating self&rsquo;.

I didn&rsquo;t understand in the beginning what photojournalism meant, until I really started doing it,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After he graduated from the New York University, his first foreign photojournalism assignment was covering the Panama conflict in &rsquo;89, when his photos were used to justify the US&rsquo; invasion of the area.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;It was at that time I understood the power of photography. Not that I agreed with the invasion, but it was more of an understanding that the work I was doing was part of a conversation that could play a role in impact,&rdquo; Ron says, adding, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s essentially what I&rsquo;ve been trying to do with my career &mdash; the stories that I&rsquo;ve chosen to do over 25 years is to get people to understand what&rsquo;s going on in the world.&rdquo;</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ever since, Ron has covered conflicts more than anything else across the world, but what really made him appreciate the work him and thousands of other photojournalists do, was in 1992 when he covered the Yugoslav conflict. Even though he captured war crimes on film, there was no international reaction.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;It helped me understand the other role of my photography which was this idea of creating a body of evidence, to hold people accountable for their actions and inactions,&rdquo; Ron says, adding that his photos have been used to indict a number of people involved in the crimes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ron published his work in galleries and three books so far, and teaches photography. Appreciating the talent in the country, he says, &ldquo;The generation that I&rsquo;m seeing at IPF plus the students I was teaching &mdash; the work is remarkable.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And to those hoping to &ldquo;change the world&rdquo; with photography, Ron says, &ldquo;I think the question is what the definition of &lsquo;change&rsquo; is. Can photography stop or start a war? Absolutely not. But if I have the ability to affect even one person, that&rsquo;s a lot for me. While it&rsquo;s great to have this &lsquo;change the world&rsquo; result, I&rsquo;m okay with step-by-step, person-by-person change. And I think that&rsquo;s a worthwhile way to do it.&rdquo;</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/photographer1475655198362.jpeg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baab806a12cf7ee39133b8","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"photographer"},{"text":"ron haviv"},{"text":"indian photography festival"},{"text":"photojournalism"},{"text":"us"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/books-and-art/041016/shooting-for-more.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-05T08:13:36.191Z","udate":"2016-12-17T09:49:39.551Z","expirydate":"2017-10-05T08:13:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f4b63056ac7309546c0e99","publishedOn":"2016-10-05T09:22:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"priority":99999,"audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"photographer,ron haviv,indian photography festival,photojournalism,us","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

As more people are surviving cancer, the consumption of added sugar will be an increasingly important risk factor.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The objective of this study was to closely evaluate the risk factors of sugar consumption from sugar-sweetened beverages among cancer survivors and people not diagnosed with cancer, and to our knowledge, no other studies have examined sugar-sweetened beverage intake in cancer survivors,\" noted senior author Melinda Sothern.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Recently growing evidence suggests a link between sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and the risk of pancreatic and endometrial cancer, as well as the risk of colon cancer recurrence and death among cancer survivors,\" Sothern added.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tung-Sung Tseng, Associate Professor of Public Health, along with colleagues at LSU Health New Orleans School of Public Health examined data from 22,182 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2012 data.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The survey measured the consumption of sodas, fruit-flavored drinks, sweetened fruit juices, sports drinks, energy drinks, sweetened teas and coffees and other sugar-sweetened drinks.

People with no cancer history had a higher sugar intake than cancer survivors, although this could be due to other factors including older age and gender. The sugar intake from sugar-sweetened beverages among women with cervical cancer history was much higher (60 gram/day) compared to other cancer survivors who consumed only around 30-40 gram/day. The research team also found that individuals who had high sugar intake (80 gram/day sugar) from sugar-sweetened beverages were younger, male, black, obese, current smokers, low-income, or had education levels at or below high school.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Although consuming added sugar is not recommended, people are not usually aware of how much sugar they get from sugar-sweetened beverages,\" said lead author Tung-Sung Tseng.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The American Heart Association recommends a consumption goal of no more than 450 kilocalories (kcal) of sugar-sweetened beverages or fewer than three 12-ounce cans of soda per week,\" Tseng added.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The results of the study indicate that sugar-sweetened beverage consumption behavior varies across cancers and may be related to age.

{"_id":"57f4cbc07944b33bf6b56e1c","title":"Why the Nobel Prize winning discovery of autophagy matters","subtitle":"Disruption of autophagy processes of the cell has been linked to Parkinson’s disease, type 2 diabetes.","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e90b17dbb41078bba9f","content":"<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nobel laureate Yoshinori Ohsumi&rsquo;s work on mechanisms underlying autophagy &mdash; a fundamental process of degrading and recycling cellular components &mdash; has generated much interest in the science behind the biological process. In this article, we will aim to explain the significance of this discovery and the earlier work in this area.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What is autophagy?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The word autophagy originates from Greek words auto, meaning &ldquo;self&rdquo;, and phagein, meaning &ldquo;to eat&rdquo;, according to the release put up on the Nobel Prize website. The concept emerged during the 1960s, when researchers first observed that the cell could destroy its own contents by enclosing it in membranes &ndash; autophagosomes - for degradation.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Scientists discovered during the 1950s that the cell contained specialised compartments, with enzymes that digest proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. These compartments also helped with degradation of cellular constituents. During the 1970s and 1980s, researchers explained the working of a system used to degrade proteins.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Experiments on autophagy</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Professor Ohsumi started working on protein degradation in the vacuole (the fluid-filled pocket found in the cell) in 1988. At that time scientists used yeast cells as a model for human cells. But he faced a major challenge; yeast cells are small and their inner structures are not easily distinguished under the microscope and thus he was uncertain whether autophagy even existed in this organism.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">But he reasoned that if he could disrupt the degradation process in the vacuole while the process of autophagy was active, then autophagosomes should accumulate within the vacuole and become visible under the microscope. He cultured mutated yeast lacking vacuolar degradation enzymes and simultaneously stimulated autophagy by starving the cells. Within hours, the vacuoles were filled with small vesicles that had not been degraded. His experiment proved that authophagy existed in yeast cells. He had also figured out the method to identify and characterise key genes involved in this process. This was a major breakthrough.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Within a year of his discovery of autophagy in yeast, Professor Ohsumi had identified the first genes essential for autophagy. He studied thousands of yeast mutants and identified 15 genes that are essential for autophagy. Subsequently, he characterised the proteins encoded by these genes according to their function. The results showed that autophagy is controlled by a cascade of proteins and protein complexes, each regulating a distinct stage of autophagosome initiation and formation.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Professor Ohsumi studied the function of the proteins encoded by key autophagy genes. He outlined how stress signals initiated autophagy and the mechanism by which proteins and protein complexes promoted distinct stages of autophagosome formation.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Physiological functions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Autophagy can rapidly provide fuel for energy and building blocks for renewal of cellular components, and is, therefore, essential for the cellular response to starvation and other types of stress. After infection, autophagy can eliminate invading intracellular bacteria and viruses. Autophagy contributes to embryo development and cell differentiation. Cells also use autophagy to eliminate damaged proteins and organelles, a quality control mechanism that is critical for counteracting the negative consequences of aging.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Disruption of the autophagy processes of the cell has been linked to Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, type 2 diabetes and other disorders that appear in the elderly. Mutations in autophagy genes can cause genetic disease. Disturbances in the autophagic machinery have also been linked to cancer. Efforts are on to develop drugs that can target autophagy in various diseases.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">If not for ProfessorOhsumi&rsquo;s research in the 1990s, the world would not have known the fundamental importance of autophagy in physiology and medicine.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Reference: [Information sourced from The Nobel Prize website]</em></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/nobel1475660718681.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babcefb210157e920b07f9","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"nobel prize"},{"text":"nobel prize in physiology"},{"text":"nobel prize in medicine"},{"text":"yoshinori ohsumi"},{"text":"autophagy"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/medicine-and-research/nobel-medicine-prize-a-look-at-the-winner-yoshinori-ohsumi-and-his-research/article9180293.ece","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":true,"cdate":"2016-10-05T09:45:36.447Z","udate":"2016-10-05T09:49:17.678Z","expirydate":"2017-10-05T09:45:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f4cbc07944b33bf6b56e1e","publishedOn":"2016-10-05T09:48:55.000Z","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"priority":99999,"tagsForSearch":"nobel prize,nobel prize in physiology,nobel prize in medicine,yoshinori ohsumi,autophagy","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Then there was Bale Balu, Samathu Saru, and Veera Vijayan, characters that late writer Vaandu Mama created... but they&rsquo;re all mere memories now.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Where are those endearing magazines that were edited with so much insight into young minds? They faded with time. But, a wave of new-gen Tamil magazines for children has now begun. Helmed by youngsters, they function with as much verve as Vaandu Mama, who single-handedly ran several magazines for children. <em>Minmini</em>, brought out by environmental group Poovulagin Nanbargal, has been around for three years now, and has around 15,000 subscribers. The monthly magazine focusses on environment-related stories. &ldquo;We want to show children the magic of Nature; we want them to appreciate what&rsquo;s around them, and also understand the politics that surrounds our environment,&rdquo; says G. Rajaram, the editorial coordinator.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Chennai-based magazine has contributions by well-known writers and artists, including Trotsky Marudhu. Rajaram says he wants to experiment with paintings rather than photographs. &ldquo;We recently carried a watercolour of a leopard as the wrapper and it worked very well,&rdquo; he says. The 31-year-old visualises a <em>Minmini</em> that is driven by paintings. &ldquo;Children are attracted to something that is hand-drawn. These days, they are exposed to a variety of media; so, a photo of an elephant may not be new to them, but there&rsquo;s nothing like a painting to show them an elephant&rsquo;s mammoth scale and beauty,&rdquo; he feels.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rajaram wants to revive the works of writers such as Vaandu Mama through the pages of <em>Minmini</em>. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t aspire to &lsquo;teach&rsquo; children. All we want to do is introduce them to ideas and stories related to the environment. They will take off from there.&rdquo; The team plans to hold story-telling events in schools to get closer to its readers.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Coimbatore-based quarterly <em>Kutti Aagaayam</em> (meaning Little Sky) is just two issues old and is already creating waves. T.S. Venkatesan, who runs it, says that it began four years ago in a Government school in Karamadai. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m part of Vaanam, a group that works with children. We spent a lot of time with children in the school, telling them stories, screening movies, and holding puppet shows,&rdquo; recalls the 36-year-old. &ldquo;At one point, we had a treasure trove of stories, poems, and art works by children. We felt it was a shame if they were to get wasted. That&rsquo;s why the magazine was started &mdash; to provide a platform for children to showcase their creativity.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Kutti Aagaayam</em> has 36 pages and includes stories by adults as well. &ldquo;They write on education and child health,&rdquo; says Ventkat, who is in the printing business. &ldquo;Our team consists of over 20 school teachers. We also have an editorial board that&rsquo;s constituted by children,&rdquo; he adds. Children form a major part of their brain-storming sessions. &ldquo;We once filled an entire section with questions a little girl had about the world around her. It was fascinating.&rdquo;</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Venkat says that 30 to 40 years ago, there were about 50 magazines in Tamil for children. &ldquo;There are only a handful now. It&rsquo;s not that there were no attempts made to revive the format, but a lot of them failed. <em>Chinna Nadhi</em> and <em>Oonjal</em> are some of the names that couldn&rsquo;t sustain,&rdquo; he says.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Thumbi</em> is a monthly that comes out of Thiruvannamalai. Tastefully done in handmade paper, it stands out for its quality. The people behind it, though, prefer to keep a low profile.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&lsquo;A story a month&rsquo;, is their motto. Each edition consists of one illustrated story in Tamil and English &mdash; the founders want readers to mull over the story with nothing else to distract them. For, they believe that a powerful story is all that a child needs to expand his/her horizons.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The first edition, dated June 2016, carried the story <em>Zlateh</em> by Isaac Bashevis Singer, with gorgeous illustrations by Prakash. <em>Thumbi</em>&rsquo;s defining factor &mdash; a cardboard bookmark shaped like its namesake, the dragonfly.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Coimbatore-based children&rsquo;s writer Sella Ganapathy misses the magazines of his times. &ldquo;We had writers who wrote such evocative wildlife stories. Several decades ago, we had Ko. Ma. Kothandam, for instance, who would spend time in the forests and write about it for children.&rdquo; The Bal Sahitya Puraskar Award winner says the trend for children&rsquo;s writing in Tamil has never been positive. &ldquo;These days, kids feel satisfied just reading a few lines on WhatsApp,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But, there&rsquo;s an ocean out there, waiting to be explored.&rdquo;</strong></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/children1475661520946.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf66aebfe246bd8ebdfe5","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"poonthalir"},{"text":"jil jil"},{"text":"damaram"},{"text":"sangu"},{"text":"mittai"},{"text":"tamil children’s magazines"},{"text":"irumbu manithan"},{"text":"thiruvannamalai"},{"text":"zlateh"},{"text":"sella ganapathy"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/array-of-tamil-childrens-magazines-to-choose-from/article9180247.ece","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-05T09:58:59.181Z","udate":"2016-12-17T10:05:18.288Z","expirydate":"2017-10-05T09:58:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f4cee37944b33bf6b56e92","publishedOn":"2016-10-05T10:10:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"priority":99999,"audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"poonthalir,jil jil,damaram,sangu,mittai,tamil children’s magazines,irumbu manithan,thiruvannamalai,zlateh,sella ganapathy","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

{"_id":"57f4d0520559f9093bcc7431","title":"Love for a layered sound","subtitle":"Artist: Spud In The Box, Album: Lead Feet Paper Shoes","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mumbai alternative rock band Spud In The Box had an emphatic rise to find themselves playing to not just the college competition crowd, but also well-populated gig series such as the erstwhile Live From the Console in Mumbai and festivals including NH7 Weekender. But then, that was in the first two years of the band&rsquo;s existence, between 2011 and 2013, when they had their first EP, the exuberant <em>Attention Please</em>, out in 2012.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the three years that followed, Spud In The Box ran the risk of a sophomore slump, something all too familiar with most Indian rock bands. They began recording in 2014, but it is only now, after much delays and time taken off to concentrate on commercial work to fund the album, that <em>Lead Feet Paper Shoes</em>has been released for public consumption.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Understandably, some of these songs are old. The destructively melodic &lsquo;Bullet Points&rsquo; kicks things off after &lsquo;Drown In&rsquo; sets the mood as a prologue. Songs like &lsquo;Use Your Words&rsquo;, with its proggy keyboard layers duelling with sprightly guitar lines and a driving rhythm section, sounds even trippier than anyone who had seen it performed live in the last four years. &lsquo;Highs &amp; Lows&rsquo; clocks in at over six minutes but sounds even more rumbling than before and &lsquo;Manic&rsquo; sounds like the most anthemic thing you&rsquo;ll ever hear from the band.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Spud certainly loves working with a layered sound &ndash; whether it&rsquo;s vocalists Rohan Rajadhyaksha and Ankit Dayal forming one of the best harmony duos to bassist Zubin Bhathena grooving with drummer Joshua Singh or guitarists Hartej Sawhney and Siddharth Talwar wielding spot-on complimentary tones. &lsquo;Crime&rsquo; and &lsquo;Institute of Madness&rsquo; harken back to their college rock days, but with a subtle touch of maturity.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Songs like &lsquo;Headrush&rsquo; and &lsquo;Hold Your Horses Closer&rsquo; are the real curveballs, though. Twisting and turning like few other compositions, you can tell the <em>Lead Feet Paper Shoes</em>&rsquo; tracklist vaguely follows a timeline of growing up and facing your problems. The quiet acceptance of the title tracks &ndash; &lsquo;Lead Feet&rsquo; and the heavenly &lsquo;Paper Shoes&rsquo;, which features guest vocals by UK-based Hebe Morwenna &ndash; are just the best way to draw out the album towards its close.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">And as much as they love the sound and the fury, they can navigate a simple song like &lsquo;Until We Fall&rsquo;, featuring violinist Suresh Lalwani, piano and Rajadhyaksha&rsquo;s stirring lyrics, &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re going back and forth/For what it&rsquo;s worth/I really don&rsquo;t want to be/Just a spark in your flames.&rdquo; <em>Lead Feet Paper Shoes</em>is going to keep Spud&rsquo;s spark going for years to come.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/music1475661888003.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf66aebfe246bd8ebdfe5","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"music"},{"text":"cd"},{"text":"dvd"},{"text":"beatstreet"},{"text":"spud in the box"},{"text":"lead feet paper shoes"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/love-for-a-layered-sound/article9184034.ece","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-05T10:05:06.154Z","udate":"2016-12-17T09:50:57.542Z","expirydate":"2017-10-05T10:05:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f4d0520559f9093bcc7433","publishedOn":"2016-10-05T10:10:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"priority":99999,"audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"music,cd,dvd,beatstreet,spud in the box,lead feet paper shoes","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

{"_id":"57f4d7af0559f9093bcc751c","title":"From the Rig Veda to Ruskin Bond: the history of nature writing in India","subtitle":"Stephen Alter","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8ff4af76df6bbfd6adfd","subsectionId":"","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_800x600/HT/p2/2016/02/11/Pictures/_62cb27be-d0ac-11e5-a2fe-c1a20f4c7a81.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In one of Kalidas&rsquo;s most famous poems, Meghaduta (cloud messenger), a subject of King Kubera (the god of wealth in Hindu mythology) is exiled to central India. He convinces a passing cloud to take a message to his wife in the Himalayas. &ldquo;Kalidas describes how the cloud travels over the country. As he writes about it, he describes the forests,&rdquo; says nature writer Stephen Alter (59), who has written more than 15 books, including The Secret Sanctuary (2015) and Elephas Maximus: A Portrait of the Indian Elephant (2004). Alter says that many metaphors and imagery in early languages like Sanskrit and Brahmi were drawn from nature. &ldquo;The Rig Veda has a number of hymns related to nature. One of the most beautiful ones is to goddess Aranyani, the spirit of the forest.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Much of Alter&rsquo;s work revolves around nature and wildlife. Alter says, &ldquo;I was fortunate to have grown up in Mussoorie. There were forests all around me and, of course, the Himalaya on all sides. That inspired me. It&rsquo;s where my imagination caught fire.&rdquo; So, it was only natural, when he started writing, that his topics were related to nature. For instance, his novel, Amritsar to Lahore: A Journey Across the India-Pakistan Border (2000), a travelogue about crossing the border between the two countries, focuses a great deal on the details of birds and trees found on both sides.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">India&rsquo;s natural beauty has inspired renowned writers such as Jim Corbett and Rudyard Kipling, who lived extensively in India and wrote tales related to the country&rsquo;s jungles and animals. They are hailed as legends today, but their work was well-received even at the time of publication. Alter says, &ldquo;Though Kipling&rsquo;s Jungle Book (1894) has been much more popular since Disney picked it up, it certainly was well-read back then too. Jim Corbett&rsquo;s Man-Eaters of Kumaon (1944) went on to sell four million copies worldwide.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But writers that interest Alter the most are those whose work incorporates a message of environmental conservation. Ruskin Bond, who is often a child&rsquo;s first introduction to nature writing, has often touched upon conservation with books such as The Cherry Tree (1980) and The Blue Umbrella (1974). &ldquo;That&rsquo;s important, as kids are extremely receptive to stories about wildlife and nature.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Proceed with Caution</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In his foreword of When the Tiger was King (2010), a collection of short stories on tigers, edited by Ruskin Bond, he suggests that 20 years from now, a child might not recognise goddess Durga&rsquo;s steed instantly. One might even express surprise that there were tigers in India once. Surely, this statement from one of our finest nature writers is alarming.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the past few years, India witnessed plenty of campaigns to save our tigers, highlighting the fact that there were only 1,411 left. Though the campaign picked up significant popularity, Alter is not sure if it was enough. &ldquo;No doubt the campaigns are well-intentioned, but there&rsquo;s more to be done alongside. As a community or a nation, I don&rsquo;t know whether the commitment is there,&rdquo; Alter says. &ldquo;There are plenty of laws in place to protect wildlife, but it&rsquo;s their enforcement which is crucial. Also, the government needs to involve communities living in and around the forests, and give funds to researchers and conservationists, who will know how to protect [the forests].&rdquo;<img src=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_640x362/HT/p2/2016/02/11/Pictures/_b2a5e234-d0ab-11e5-a2fe-c1a20f4c7a81.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"362\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Additionally, today, there is more global focus on climate change. With pollution levels reaching dangerously high levels in metro cities, Alter endorses the odd-even rule that was enforced in Delhi recently. &ldquo;Years ago, when there were CNG auto rickshaws and buses in Delhi, it made an enormous difference. I lived there at the time. Unfortunately, that didn&rsquo;t last as many of us had hoped it would,&rdquo; he says. He is all for whatever measures we can take to curb our demand for fossil fuels, and feels that it&rsquo;d bode well for all cities that have issues with traffic and pollution.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5 Must-Read Nature Writings</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">* <strong>The King and I by Prerna Singh Bindra</strong>: A lively and perceptive personal memoir of encounters with tigers and other wildlife in different parts of India.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>* On Jim Corbett&rsquo;s Trail by AJT Johnsingh: </strong>A respected conservationist tells entertaining stories of his quest to follow in Corbett&rsquo;s footsteps, while tracking unusual animals like the dhole or wild dog.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>* The Way of the Tiger by K Ullas Karanth: </strong>An eloquent and persuasive argument for the preservation of tigers, from one of the foremost wildlife biologists in India.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>* My Husband and Other Animals by Janaki Lenin: </strong>A wonderful series of short, anecdotal accounts of natural history, full of humour and understanding.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>* Butterflies on the Roof of the World by Peter Smetacek: </strong>A fascinating saga of a family&rsquo;s obsession with butterflies and one man&rsquo;s dedication to entomology, which reads as smoothly as a novel.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><em>&mdash; By Stephen Alter</em></strong></span></p>","publishersId":"57ecf27934a4ac2d218b21ca","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"stephen alter"},{"text":"natural poetry"},{"text":"rigveda"},{"text":"ruskin bond"},{"text":"jungle book"}],"langIdentifier":"en","artcleType":"Article","statsId":"57f4d7af0559f9093bcc751e","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.hindustantimes.com/books/from-the-rig-veda-to-ruskin-bond-the-history-of-nature-writing-in-india/story-9sBfVKuywbikrgA2PFv7BJ.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-05T10:36:31.692Z","udate":"2016-12-17T10:05:29.551Z","expirydate":"2017-10-05T10:36:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-04T18:30:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","showEditableRow":false,"pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out1180.mp3","tagsForSearch":"stephen alter,natural poetry,rigveda,ruskin bond,jungle book","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

As more people are surviving cancer, the consumption of added sugar will be an increasingly important risk factor.<br /><br />\"The objective of this study was to closely evaluate the risk factors of sugar consumption from sugar-sweetened beverages among cancer survivors and people not diagnosed with cancer, and to our knowledge, no other studies have examined sugar-sweetened beverage intake in cancer survivors,\" noted senior author Melinda Sothern.<br /><br />\"Recently growing evidence suggests a link between sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and the risk of pancreatic and endometrial cancer, as well as the risk of colon cancer recurrence and death among cancer survivors,\" Sothern added.<br /><br />Tung-Sung Tseng, Associate Professor of Public Health, along with colleagues at LSU Health New Orleans School of Public Health examined data from 22,182 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2012 data.<br /><br />The survey measured the consumption of sodas, fruit-flavored drinks, sweetened fruit juices, sports drinks, energy drinks, sweetened teas and coffees and other sugar-sweetened drinks. It also ascertained cancer, smoking and obesity status, as well as demographic characteristics including age, gender, race, educational level and poverty/income ratio.<br /><br />For the overall study population, 15.7 percent had high sugar intake from sugar-sweetened drinks. People with no cancer history had a higher sugar intake than cancer survivors, although this could be due to other factors including older age and gender. The sugar intake from sugar-sweetened beverages among women with cervical cancer history was much higher (60 gram/day) compared to other cancer survivors who consumed only around 30-40 gram/day. The research team also found that individuals who had high sugar intake (80 gram/day sugar) from sugar-sweetened beverages were younger, male, black, obese, current smokers, low-income, or had education levels at or below high school.<br /><br />\"Although consuming added sugar is not recommended, people are not usually aware of how much sugar they get from sugar-sweetened beverages,\" said lead author Tung-Sung Tseng.<br /><br />\"The American Heart Association recommends a consumption goal of no more than 450 kilocalories (kcal) of sugar-sweetened beverages or fewer than three 12-ounce cans of soda per week,\" Tseng added.<br /><br />The results of the study indicate that sugar-sweetened beverage consumption behavior varies across cancers and may be related to age. The LSU Health New Orleans translational research team suggested that intervention programs to reduce sugar-sweetened beverage or added sugar consumption should primarily focus on lower socio-economic status young males, both non-cancer and cancer survivors, as well as cervical cancer survivors.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They also recommended that custom intervention to decrease added sugar consumption be conducted for both non-cancer individuals and cancer survivors in communities and the medical care system.</p>\n<div class=\"last6brdiv\">The study is published in Translational Cancer Research.</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/age1475663950385.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babcefb210157e920b07f9","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"cancer"},{"text":"sugar-sweetened beverages"},{"text":"lsu health"},{"text":"new orleans"},{"text":"obesity"},{"text":"diabetes"},{"text":"cardio-metabolic diseases"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/Age-an-important-factor-that-links-cancer-sugar-sweetened-beverages/articleshow/54671496.cms","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":true,"cdate":"2016-10-05T10:39:28.042Z","udate":"2016-10-05T11:23:45.754Z","expirydate":"2017-10-05T10:39:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f4d8607944b33bf6b56f85","publishedOn":"2016-10-05T11:23:27.000Z","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"priority":99999,"tagsForSearch":"cancer,sugar-sweetened beverages,lsu health,new orleans,obesity,diabetes,cardio-metabolic diseases","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

{"_id":"57f4e7e56abc2e1a9e5ce1d6","title":"Living a Complete Life is the Legacy of Krishna","subtitle":"Desh Kapoor","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fb6af76df6bbfd6adfc","content":"<p>Shri Krishna cannot be understood in percentages. He has to be known completely. Anything less and you will miss everything about Krishna. He was a lover, statesman, politician, warrior, Sage, friend, Dancer, Artist and Pacifist. At least those are the dimensions that we can see. But when he was asked by Arjun as to who he was, he chose to equate himself to everything in the creation. &ldquo;I am All&rdquo;, he said!</p>\n<p>Depending on their tendencies, people &ndash; devotees and even Sages &ndash; have chosen to concentrate on one or few dimensions of Krishna. But knowing limited dimensions of him is to not know Krishna at all. He is the existence and life itself. You cannot say that I will live only 50% of my life today. You either live or you don&rsquo;t. One cannot live in percentages. Similarly, you cannot understand Krishna in a few dimensions and leave out others. So, if Krishna has to be accepted, he has to be accepted in full. That is the greatness of Krishna and the difficulty in understanding him.</p>\n<p>The holistic nature of Krishna is also reflected in the holistic nature of Bhagwad Gita itself. Very few Sages have gone beyond perfecting one Yoga. A Jnana Yogi who has reached the highest state can credibly share the journey as he took on that path. A Bhakti Yogi can discuss credibly about the power of devotion. But in no other case, has anyone been able to discuss all the four Yogas &ndash; Bhakti, Karma, Jnana, and Raja &ndash; like Krishna did. His discussion is not intellectual, but that of a Realized Being. Living life in complete intensity and clarity is an essential part to understand Krishna and his message.</p>\n<p>कर्मण्यकर्म यः पश्येदकर्मणि च कर्म यः।<br />स बुद्धिमान्मनुष्येषु स युक्तः कृत्स्नकर्मकृत्॥४-१८॥</p>\n<p>In this verse, Krishna says one who see Akarma (lack of Karma) in performance of Karma and Karma in not performance of Karma, is the real wise person. When one sees no Karma is being performed in every and any Karma, then one can freely attempt and do everything completely. Inaction, on the other hand, does not mean lack of Karma. Instead, meaningless inaction adds to one&rsquo;s Karma.</p>\n<p>The body and mind are nothing but instruments and repositories of Karma. There is nothing more to them and nothing less. To utilize these two instruments to the fullest yet knowing that these are but tools in &ldquo;your&rdquo; hands and not &ldquo;you&rdquo; is the point of realization.</p>\n<p>Realization of unattached Karma and the primacy of the underlying &ldquo;Chetna&rdquo; or Consciousness leads one to perform all actions with complete passion without hesitation. That is the central theme of Krishna and his life. Complete Holistic life.</p>\n<p>Beyond the material body is the energy state of our existence. If at the sub atomic level, everything is energy, then we are nothing more than energy states. Somewhere at the grosser level we manifest the body. This is the Physical fact. Biological fact does not see the non-material energy state existence. It deals only with material.</p>\n<p>When one dies biologically, one dies physically. But at the energy level, what dies? That is the difference between Shareer (Body) and Shareeri (Atman). What is material (biological) can die. But that which is non-material (Energy state) cannot die. It is the same through the entire existence.</p>\n<p>Violence and non-violence in material terms are of biological nature. At the energy level there is no violence nor non-violence.</p>\n<p>Morals and convictions are for the material. At the energy levels there are no morals. To go beyond the Sattvik, Tamasik and the Rajas &ndash; the good, bad and neutral is to live as a liberated being.</p>\n<p>Such a state does not come by living in percentages but from a life lived in its entirety. That is Krishna&rsquo;s greatest legacy.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/krishna-9468331475667928310.jpeg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","publisherSectionName":"drishtikone.com","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"krishna's legacy"},{"text":"bhagawadgita"},{"text":"complete life"},{"text":"karma yoga"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://drishtikone.com/living-complete-life-krishnas-legacy/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-05T11:45:41.493Z","udate":"2016-12-17T10:51:15.482Z","expirydate":"2017-10-05T11:45:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-04T18:30:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","publiseherSectionId":"57f4e6af6abc2e1a9e5ce19b","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f4e7e56abc2e1a9e5ce1d8","priority":99999,"audioImageUrl":"","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"tagsForSearch":"krishna's legacy,bhagawadgita,complete life,karma yoga","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

To discuss with them your fears about the meaning of your passport. To share with them the results of your investigations into the meaning of the rent equation. It is important to explain the central mathematics of the noises they&rsquo;ll have heard coming from your apartment at random hours of the day and night. To demonstrate both the internal and external nature of those hours, and their connection with the signals you receive from the lights in windows you can see from your balcony, and how those signals reflect the secret passions contained in your passport, and how all of this determines how many times a day you think about suicide, and murder. Think about, not contemplate. That&rsquo;s a very important distinction, and one not unrelated to the enormous electronic screech you sometime hear coming from what you can only assume must be the centre of the earth. Always make it clear that the centre of the earth is more than likely not where they think it is. That there are storms that have been raging there for longer than the collective age of everyone who lives in this city, both documented and undocumented. That you love only sex workers, drug addicts, refugees and the terminally ill. That most mornings you think they are the only people deserving of citizenship. That you are disturbed by the hatred continually emitting from the drawer in which you keep your passport. It is important they understand how that hatred&rsquo;s foul metallic shriek is in no way connected with the way in which you would like to continue to conduct your business. That your business is somehow connected with the scorched and horrific colours the sky produces as it sends murderous darts through your window each evening between the hours of 8 and 9. The reasons you have for burying those darts in the shallowest earth. The meaning of the gentle sounds you make as you do this. It is important to be on good terms, to share your knowledge, your sugar, your brightly coloured powders.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/Instandbesetzer_Berlin_Kreuzberg_19811475668387519.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"sean bonney"},{"text":"modern poetry"},{"text":"prose poetry"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd191afb61356b41a1bb48","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://abandonedbuildings.blogspot.in/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-05T11:53:12.325Z","udate":"2016-12-17T10:53:32.003Z","expirydate":"2017-10-05T11:53:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-04T18:30:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f4e9a8a5385b1ab9836d48","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out5611.mp3","priority":99999,"audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"sean bonney,modern poetry,prose poetry","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

After 15 years, they have come together to organise an art exhibition at Lalithakala Akademi Art Gallery, displaying more than 50 paintings. The aim behind this initiative by the 1998-2000 batch was to relive the beautiful days through a medium all of them love the most.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The exhibition titled Colour Way turned out to be a confluence of various painting techniques and mediums. They will be using a part of the sales proceeds for charity purposes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It became an unforgettable experience for some who had taken a break from art to fulfill their other responsibilities in life.

I have now decided not to give up art.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Majority of the paintings reflect the social problems that we face including the killing of stray dogs, selfie obsession, suppression of women and corruption. &ldquo;Our works are derived from our childhood memories as well as existing social issues.

But if you're having possible heart attack symptoms, don't delay getting help because you're worried about which hospital to go to, said another study leader, Yale cardiologist Dr. Harlan Krumholz.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Just call 911. Too many people wait at home too long,\" and any delay means more risk of permanent heart damage, he said. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health. Results were published Wednesday by the New England Journal of Medicine.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hospitals often are rated based on their heart attack death rates at 30 days, taking into account how sick their patients were, such as how many had diabetes. But it's not known whether doing well in the short term translates to a lasting benefit.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The new study finds it does. Researchers compared life expectancy for 120,000 Medicare patients treated between 1994 and 1996 at roughly 1,800 hospitals. The difference in life expectancy at top and low performing hospitals emerged at 30 days and remained over time.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"This is really an important study,\" said an independent expert, Dr. Ralph Brindis, a University of California at San Francisco cardiologist and former president of the American College of Cardiology. \"Delivering better care not only saves lives, but that the gain persists over 17 years, independent of how sick the patients were initially.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Heart attack care has improved a lot since the 1990s, but more recent comparisons of short-term hospital mortality rates show that big differences still exist. \"Where the good hospitals in your community are is worth knowing,\" Bucholz said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And they're not necessarily the ones that advertise on TV. Medicare has a website that lets you check how they do in your area and be prepared, especially if you or someone in your family is at high risk for a heart attack.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Heart attack symptoms can be sudden, but many start slowly, with mild pain or discomfort, according to the American Heart Association.

Botox in the bladder muscle works to address urgency urinary incontinence by relaxing the overactive bladder muscles that cause the condition.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A sacral neuromodulation implant does the same thing by sending electrical pulses to nerves in the spine. The study's lead author Cindy L. Amundsen said, \"Urgency urinary incontinence is common, with 17 percent of women over age 45 and 25 percent of women over age 75 suffering from it. That's why it's important for both patients and health care providers to have information that can guide their choice between these two therapies.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The study involved 381 women from nine U.S. medical centers, who recorded at least six urgency incontinent episodes over three consecutive days and had not improved with other treatments.

However, the Botox patients also had three times the rate of urinary tract infections.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some botulinum toxin participants also required intermittent self-catheterization, although at lower rates than reported in previous studies using this dose.

It was aimed to highlight the social, economic and cultural relationship which exists between India and Africa.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The objective of the event was to showcase the African continent with all its diversity in terms of cultures and traditions. Malini Kochupillai one of the participating artists said, &ldquo;These are people who are very similar to us as are their desires and aspirations.&rdquo; Her 12-page mock newspaper &ldquo;Khirkee Voice/Khirkee ki Awaaz&rdquo; focusing on the lives of Africans living in Khirkee village was one of the works displayed at the event. Describing racism as a &ldquo;disturbing feeling&rdquo;, Kochupillai said, &ldquo;It does not feel nice to be targeted because you look in a certain way.&rdquo; Coming from a mixed parentage, she recalls being discomforted by her skin colour as a child growing up in Delhi.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Andrew Ananda Voogel whose artworks portrayed the trading of Indian labour to Caribbean made a pertinent point on the habit of people to stare at those who look different. &ldquo;Staring hurts.

Balamurugan wields magic in his deft hands as be brings to life hundreds of idols of Gods and Goddesses","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sirpi A. Balamurugan wields magic in his deft hands as he brings to life hundreds of idols of Gods and Goddesses on gigantic Gopurams across old and modern temples in the State. Hailing from a nondescript village named Edathanur in Tiruvannamalai district, Balamurugan, a school dropout took interest in the &lsquo;Suthai&rsquo; work that&rsquo;s part of temple constructions. &ldquo;I always had interest in arts and was good at sketching. Noticing my talent, Sirpi Rajasekhar, a sculptor from Kumbakonam took me in as his shishya. I stayed with him for months and learnt the art of sculpting idols from cement and sand,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;In the villages of Tiruvannamalai when the rains fail and agriculture takes a beating, a number of people migrate to the cities to work as construction labourers. I am happy that I didn&rsquo;t end up as just another labourer but recognised as a sculptor.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Balamurugan has worked in over 200 temples across Tamil Nadu, Andhra, Karnataka and Kerala. &ldquo;The delta districts are famous for this art. However, there&rsquo;s demand for suthai work even in North India. The look and feel of modern South Indian Gopurams with those colourful idols perched on them is entirely dependent on the sirpis,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Apart from the Gopuram idols, we also design the ornate tiruvachi arches, domes and yazhi motives that you see commonly in temples.&rdquo;</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The idols are initially given a basic shape with an iron framework, upon which broken bricks are filled in. Once a substantial form is achieved, it&rsquo;s further refined by using cement. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worked upon in three layers. The final finish is given with water mixed with cement. The work is laborious as the cement gets dried quickly. Once dry, changes cannot be made to the sculpture, so it&rsquo;s important to work continuously. The idols are made right there on top of the gopuram, contrary to the belief that they are made separately and later stuck on top.&rdquo;</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">There&rsquo;s also a set of rules to be followed in the suthai work, says Balamurugan. &ldquo;We divide the entire idol in nearly nine bhagams (portions) in order to achieve the right proportion in the given space.&rdquo; He has worked in famous temples like the Poondi Sivan Temple, repair works in Brihadeeswara Temple, Thanjavur and Singaperumal temple, Nagarcoil. &ldquo;In the olden days, thin wooden sticks were used to give the frame instead of steel/iron,&rdquo; observes Balamurugan. &ldquo;If the idol is too intricate then it may take even 20 days. But if the work is simple, I can finish it in just two days. I consider it as a blessing to be involved in temple construction works.&rdquo;</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/idol1475730141378.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf66aebfe246bd8ebdfe5","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"sirpi balamurugan"},{"text":"modern temple architecture"},{"text":"idol making"},{"text":"sirpi a. balamurugan"},{"text":"kumbakonam"},{"text":"gopuram idols"},{"text":"brihadeeswara temple"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/art/sirpi-a-balamurugan-talks-about-his-role-in-modern-day-temple-architecture/article9188822.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-06T05:02:40.912Z","udate":"2016-12-17T09:44:09.481Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f5daf01e1a126a9343f5d0","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-06T07:16:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out4963.mp3","priority":99999,"audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"sirpi balamurugan,modern temple architecture,idol making,sirpi a. balamurugan,kumbakonam,gopuram idols,brihadeeswara temple","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57f5dc0288cbdd6a5d6eb985","title":"On a quest in a virtual world","subtitle":"‘Avataar’, staged by Nireeksha Women’s Theatre, delves into a virtual world of shifting identities, trivialised emotions and inane conversations.","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">However hard she tries, the woman finds it impossible to get to her past to rebuild her lost identity. Did she ever have one, she wonders.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">History is replete with tales of domination and conquests, but all of men&rsquo;s. About women, it remains strangely silent. Desperately she returns and loses herself in a virtual world, frenziedly swapping profiles and sifting through chat rooms to see whether she could catch a whiff of her essence, perhaps scattered and caught inside those meaningless chats in social media.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The eternal search continues&hellip;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nireeksha Women&rsquo;s Theatre&rsquo;s new play &lsquo;Avataar&rsquo;, which was staged at Vyloppilly Samskriti Bhavan in the capital city last week, is a searing exploration of the identity of woman and relationships in the virtual world - its razor-thin affairs, souless social media posts, floating profiles, shifting identities - that has made a dent in the real world too.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The loneliness to which the hero Navin is condemned to, as he works in an oil rig abroad with the &lsquo;weight of the blue&rsquo; inconsolably eating into his thoughts and dreams, represents the plight of all men who try to reach out from their island selves. His only contact with the mainland are occasional chats with his lover, Siji. He skims on the surface of that relationship, never wanting to go beyond what he gets from Siji&rsquo;s profile page. Her social media posts dripping with love, which are all poetic quotes Siji has lifted from elsewhere, were enough for Navin to project on to her an image of an ideal lover who could ease his sufferings.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A real woman with her own wishes would probably have terrified him. After all, only projections, reflections and echoes matter in social media.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The fragile world would have held on if the real woman had not shaken off the chimera and announced that she wanted to get real - a grave sin that shatters the glass walls of social media etiquette.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The defaulter must suffer.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The viewers follow the agonies of Siji who now sets out to find her past, her lost identity. Her last name Kottoor might have taken her to the house where she was born, but Siji realises, that such real places, soaked in the earthy odours of soil and blood that lie unmapped by search engines, have long lost their moorings and drifted away to unreachable distances, a grim pointer to the future. She must once again get back to the virtual world, from where she began, for the search to continue.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Meanwhile the heroine finds in Deepa, her online friend, a woman who has learnt the skill of living in the new world. Love can exist only if there is distance between the participants, Siji learns from her, and virtual media offers that aloofness. Come close only at the risk of falling apart. &ldquo;Three minutes,&rdquo; she tells Siji, with the pain of her experiences thrumming behind the sarcasm, &ldquo;three minutes is all it takes for any relation between man and woman to decide between bed and violence.&rdquo; Deepa has already seen enough violence in her life.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whenever the viewer loses his bearing in the ever shifting dunes of the virtual world, the character Troll weaves into the story on roller skates, with his scathing but enlightening comments. His uneasy questions can either be dodged or confronted head on. But don&rsquo;t think he offers any resolution.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">E. Rajarajeswari&rsquo;s brilliant script etches the life of a woman, any woman, her search for identity and her frustrations in the virtual world. Men are not portrayed in a bleak, one-sided light; they also get caught in the roiling waves of fast-shuffling identities of the virtual world. Yet, at least, they have an identity and a history of conquests to fall back on. For a woman, it is a post-modern play of surfaces, without any roots or essence.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;It took nearly five years for this story to evolve,&rdquo; says Rajarajeswari. To find visual tropes to a story that deals with the virtual world, where all action revolves around social media chats, is a tall order for any director. Here is where Sudhi Devayani excels. &ldquo;The theme was challenging, and its resonances were many,&rdquo; says Sudhi.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;The decision to bring in the trampoline as a platform was a key moment during our research. Everything else suddenly fell into place.&rdquo; In the play, whenever tension mounts we see the characters go bouncing on the trampoline. &ldquo;It requires immense balance and skill to stay afloat in the virtual world,&rdquo; Rajarajeswari says.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aswathy Chand Kishore&rsquo;s Siji and Sarat Sabha&rsquo;s Navin sizzle as the main characters.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Prasoon V.T., Biresh Krishnan, Molamma K and Neena Gireesh also put in good performances. Brilliant scenography and subtle lighting by Shibu S. Kottaram takes the play to another sublime level.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/theatre1475730414667.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf66aebfe246bd8ebdfe5","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"avataar"},{"text":"nireeksha women's theatre"},{"text":", e. rajarajeswari"},{"text":"sudhi devayani"},{"text":"prasoon v.t., biresh krishnan"},{"text":"molamma k"},{"text":"neena gireesh"},{"text":"aswathy chand kishore"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/theatre/nireeksha-womens-theatre-stages-its-new-production-avataar/article9191928.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-06T05:07:14.269Z","udate":"2016-12-17T09:44:20.496Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f5dc0288cbdd6a5d6eb987","expirydate":"2016-11-04T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-06T07:17:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6971.mp3","priority":99999,"audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"avataar,nireeksha women's theatre,, e. rajarajeswari,sudhi devayani,prasoon v.t., biresh krishnan,molamma k,neena gireesh,aswathy chand kishore","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Luv Kush Ramleela, Delhi's biggest Ramleela, is back with 45 film and television actors as part of the huge star cast. Not only actors, politicians and sportspersons are also donning grease paint to play popular mythical figures on the elaborate stage set up in Lal Quila maidan.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is an interesting line up of actors. The audience will see Gagan Malik as Ram, Gurleen Chopra as Sita, Gajendra Chauhan as Ravan, Manoj Prabhakar as Indra, Asrani as Subahu, Raja Murad as Janak, Pankaj Dheer as Dashrath, Roopa Dutta as Vedwati, Rita Bhaduri as Maa Anjani, wrestler Jagdish Kaliraman as Ahiravan, Shiva as Narad, Manoj Tiwari as Angad, Ashmit Patel as Bharat, Ravi Kishan as Kewat, Preeti Jhingiani as Ahilya, Meghna Naidu as Sulochna and Surendra Pal as Parshuram.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gagan Malik, who has already played the role of Ram in a tele-series, says it is a different experience altogether. &ldquo;It's a very big task to perform live on stage as there is no cut, rewind or retake on stage. If you deliver a dialogue incorrectly then you cannot do anything to correct it. So you have to prepare a lot before coming on the stage and performing in front of public.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Actress Gurleen Chopra, who has done films in different languages, is playing Sita. This is the first time that she is doing a live show of this magnitude. &ldquo;I like to do new things and it is a special challenge for me. I have done lot of preparations to understand Sita's character and her point of view. Speaking chaste Hindi is also a task, says Gurleen, adding she has tried to understand the idea behind the rituals as well. &ldquo;So that the performance doesn't sound hollow.&rdquo;</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Seasoned actor Asrani, who has been a regular here, &ldquo;This time I am playing the role of a monster called Sabahu, I haven't done this kind of role earlier so this is very new and different role for me. It is opportunity to show different shades of my acting skills. I see it as theatre. In films there is only one camera but here you have to address a huge crowd and create connection with each of them. The good thing is you get an immediate response about your performance from the public and that helps you grow as an actor.&rdquo;</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cricket all rounder Manoj Prabhakar is testing his skills on a new pitch. &ldquo;I am playing a small but solid role of Indra who is the leader of the gods and is very powerful. As he is god of rain, he wields a lightening thunderbolt known as vajra. I am happy playing this precious role and looking forward to it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Prabhakar says his purpose of participating in Ramleela is to generate information about our mythical stories which the youngsters have forgotten. &ldquo;I feel I can connect with youngsters.&rdquo; On his acting skills, Prabhakar says, &ldquo;There is no difference between an actor and a cricketer. For me whether it's an actor or a cricketer it's the more you act the better you perform. The main thing is in acting you can have retakes but in cricket there are no retakes. And, if your purpose and focus is genuine and positive, things start falling in place.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ashok Aggarwal, President, Luv Kush Ramlila Committee, says, &ldquo;Professional actors from film and television help improve the standards of performance.&rdquo; He points out that the committee spends as much on the selection of the crew. &ldquo;We have a team of 100 technicians to choreography stunts. There are professional make-up artists and costume designers to bring alive the essence of Ramayan.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aggarwal says this year's highlights include Tadka episode and the sequence where Ravan offers his ten heads to impress Lord Shiva. &ldquo;We are also adding a new element in the form of aerial acts and fire shows this time which will bring a whole new feel to the play. We want the Ramlila to look film-like this time.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/play1475730608370.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf66aebfe246bd8ebdfe5","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"luv kush ramleela"},{"text":"gagan malik"},{"text":"gurleen chopra"},{"text":"gajendra chauhan"},{"text":"manoj prabhakar"},{"text":"asrani"},{"text":"raja murad"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/a-starstudded-show/article9188800.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-06T05:10:28.695Z","udate":"2016-12-17T09:44:40.004Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f5dcc488cbdd6a5d6eb996","expirydate":"2016-11-04T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-06T07:19:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out8496.mp3","priority":99999,"audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"luv kush ramleela,gagan malik,gurleen chopra,gajendra chauhan,manoj prabhakar,asrani,raja murad","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57f5de201e1a126a9343f5ff","title":"A new medium for narration","subtitle":"Preethi Athreya’s ‘Conditions of Carriage’ explores body as a functional being","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb900dea63af2cd0d814cf","content":"<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The performance space is a square pit created with wooden planks on all sides and in that space a group of people walk, run and jump, as the cavity of the pit resonates with the impact of bodies hurtling in and springing out. That is &lsquo;Conditions of Carriage&rsquo;, a performance conceptualised by dancer and choreographer Preethi Athreya and her team.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;The main idea is that the condition by which you carry yourself and the people around you keep changing in life. The performance is all about how we negotiate the space between us and how we negotiate our own body to strike a harmony,&rdquo; says Preethi Athreya.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Supported by the Indian Foundation for the Arts under its Arts Practice programme and organised in collaboration with Arul Anandar College and Manalmagudi Theatre Land, the performance brought to light how the vertical axis dissolves and bodies give in to the pull of the earth.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Basically a classical dancer, Preethi Athreya explores body as narrative medium and explains what prompts her to venture into this project. &ldquo;The origin of the project goes back to my obsession with the functional body in contrast to the performative body. As a Bharathanatyam dancer once during a performance I noticed audience frequently get distracted by the movement of the backstage crew of the next programme. It was a revelation of sorts for me. I wondered how normal body movement could attract the attention of the audience when a highly stylised art form like Bharathanatyam was in progress. From then on I tried to evolve a performance using functional body as a communicative tool,&rdquo; she says.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jumping reveals mechanics of the body as there is no decorative element in it as in any dance form. In &lsquo;Conditions of Carriage&rsquo;, called a jumping project, performers stand side-by-side, pushing away from the ground and reaching for a space and time that is suspended. As actions both jumping and running have a telling effect on the energy of the environment. The performers try to explore the space between them. In the course of action they also spill out of the pit but slide back in and gradually fall into the rhythm. Connected to each other by time, they run in spirals, becoming orbits of themselves and each other. Every time they come closer, audience expect a collision but the performers time their movements to perfection to avoid the clash. Energy accelerates and individualities surface as the performers move around within the confines of the pit. Moving, dodging, standing, breathing, counting, they are drawn together once again, in a collective spiral.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Bodies are at once powerful and vulnerable as they navigate their exhaustion. The idea of borders and limitations are displaced at once. We worked out of SPACES art foundation, Chennai, where the idea of space as a changing entity became a preoccupation for me,&rdquo; she says.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The performance was like an abstract painting packed with layers of meaning with different levels of understanding. At one level it talked about personal space and public space and at another level it showed how technological advancement in communication had actually widened the gap between two individuals as people have become more concerned about personal space and failed to take note of public space, where living in community loses its relevance.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The use of colours, especially the costumes, reflects the sentiment of the play. &ldquo;We have used only primary colours, for instance the red colour symbolises aggressiveness while the blue has a calming effect,&rdquo; she says.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are no lengthy dialogues as most of them were mono syllabic. Music score is by Paul Jacob, who has created a sound scape with his electronic and percussion instruments.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Apart from Preethi Athreya, Devika S, Dipna Daryanani, Maithily Bhupatkar, Nidhi Misra, Prabu Mani, Pravin Kannanur, Sekher Narayanan, Sruti Sriram and Vasanth Selvam were the other performers. They are drawn from different disciplines. The group comprises actors, dancers, a parkour expert and fitness enthusiasts. The performance creates a cathartic effect on the audience.

{"_id":"57f5e4bc1e1a126a9343f6a1","title":"Novel device detects bacteria and suggests apt antibiotic","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e2e34a4ac2d218b1a46","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An interdisciplinary team of engineers and pharmaceutical researchers at the <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/University-of-Alberta\">University of Alberta</a> has invented a device that can rapidly identify harmful bacteria and can determine whether it is resistant to antibiotics. The device could save precious hours in patient care and public health, and prevent the spread of drug-resistant strains of bacteria. The team's findings can help in detecting bacteria and measure their susceptibility to <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/antibiotics\">antibiotics</a> in small confined volumes.<br /><br />The device was designed to look for and trap <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/different-types-of-bacteria\">different types of bacteria</a> and find out which antibiotics are most effective against them. Rather than growing bacterial cultures then testing them, the microscopic device relies on nano-scale technology for fast results.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The main feature of the device is a <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/cantilever\">cantilever</a>, a plank that resembles a diving board that has a microfluidic channel 25 times smaller than the width of a hair etched on its surface. The channel is coated with biomaterials, like antibodies, that harmful bacteria like E. coli or Listeria in fluid samples stick to.<br /><br />When bacteria are caught, the device sends out three different signals to the researchers. When bacteria is detected, the cantilever's mass changes, and it bends, explained researcher <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Thomas-Thundat\">Thomas Thundat</a>.<br /><br />\"So, this gives us two signals: the mass change and the bending action by shining infrared light on the bacteria, a third signal is sent. If the bacterial absorbs the light, it begins to vibrate, generating a minute amount of heat that sends a confirmation signal. Having three detection methods means there is no ambiguity\".<br /><br />\"By monitoring the interaction of light and bacteria, we can get highly selective detection of bacteria,\" said Faheem Khan, another expert.<br /><br />With the bacteria trapped in the cantilever, different antibiotic drugs can be added to the device. Changes in the intensity of tiny oscillations of the cantilever signal will inform the researchers whether the bacteria are alive or dead. The researchers then know which antibiotics the bacteria are susceptible to.<br /><br />\"We're trying to find a way to fight bacterial resistance to drugs and prevent or at least decrease the spread of drug-resistant strains,\" said Hashem Etayash, a researcher. Adding, \"We're able to do several tests in a very short period of time and we can quickly identify bugs that can resist antibiotics.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />The device can be used to test extremely small fluid samples, millions of times smaller than a rain droplet. The size of the device is advantageous when you only want a very small sample, in settings such as a neonatal intensive care unit, or in situations where only very small samples are available.</p>\n<div class=\"last6brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The research was published in Nature Communications journal.</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/device1475732649867.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf24aea63af2cd0d81ce6","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"university of alberta"},{"text":"antibiotics"},{"text":"bacteria"},{"text":"cantilever"},{"text":"thomas thundat"},{"text":"faheem khan"},{"text":"nature communications journal"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/Novel-device-detects-bacteria-and-suggests-apt-antibiotic/articleshow/54694787.cms","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":true,"cdate":"2016-10-06T05:44:28.662Z","udate":"2016-10-06T07:52:58.748Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f5e4bc1e1a126a9343f6a3","expirydate":"2016-12-31T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-06T07:51:37.000Z","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out7979.mp3","priority":99999,"tagsForSearch":"university of alberta,antibiotics,bacteria,cantilever,thomas thundat,faheem khan,nature communications journal","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

I played the role of Meghnath for three consecutive years, from 1977-79. And every since then, I have been playing Ravana&rsquo;s role which has been life changing for me.

He hopes that the lineage continues and the young generation shows same passion. &ldquo; Slowly and steadily the interest in watching Ramlila has gained momentum over the years. People come in huge numbers to watch Ramlila, the same as it was last 50 years. There is no place to sit when we enact the Sita Haran scene.

{"_id":"57f5f22c747fb76a42ef77b6","title":"This excerpt from a book demolishes Ashoka’s reputation as pacifist","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fb6af76df6bbfd6adfc","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chandragupta abdicated in 298 BC (or 303 BC according to another source) in favour of his son Bindusara who ruled till 273 BC. Bindusara had inherited an empire that was already very large &mdash; from Afghanistan to Bengal. He seems to have extended the realm further south till the empire covered all but the southern tip of the peninsula. For the most part, his rule seems to have been peaceful except for a few rebellions. He also seems to have maintained diplomatic and trade links with the kingdoms carved out from Alexander&rsquo;s empire.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In 274 BC, Bindusara suddenly fell ill and died. The crown prince Sushima was away fending off incursions on the northwestern frontiers and rushed back to the imperial capital Pataliputra, present-day Patna. However, on arrival he found that Ashoka, one of his half-brothers, had taken control of the city with the help of Greek mercenaries. It appears that Ashoka had Sushima killed at the eastern gates. The crown prince may have been roasted alive in the moat! This was followed by four years of a bloody civil war in which Ashoka seems to have killed all male rivals in his family. Buddhist texts mention that he killed ninety-nine half-brothers and only spared his full brother Tissa. Hundreds of loyalist officials were also killed; Ashoka is said to have personally decapitated five hundred of them. Having consolidated his power, he was finally crowned emperor in 270 BC.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All accounts agree that Ashoka&rsquo;s early rule was brutal and unpopular, and that he was known as &lsquo;Chandashoka&rsquo; or Ashoka the Cruel. According to mainstream textbook narratives, however, Ashoka would invade Kalinga a few years later and, shocked by the death and destruction, would convert to Buddhism and become a pacifist. The reader will be surprised to discover that the popular narrative about this conversion is based on little evidence. Ashoka would invade Kalinga in 262 BC whereas we know from minor rock edicts that Ashoka had converted to Buddhism more than two years earlier. No Buddhist text links his conversion to the war and even Ashoka&rsquo;s eulogists like Charles Allen agree that his conversion predated the Kalinga war. Moreover, he seems to have had links with Buddhists for a decade before his conversion. The evidence suggests that his conversion to Buddhism was more to do with the politics of succession than with any regret he felt for sufferings of war.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Mauryans were likely to have followed Vedic court rituals (certainly many of their top officials were Brahmins) but had eclectic religious affiliations in personal life. The founder of the line, Chandragupta, seems to have had links to the Jains in old age while his son Bindusara seems to have been partial to a heterodox sect called the Ajivikas. This is not an unusual arrangement in the Dharmic (i.e. Indic) family of religions. This eclectic approach remains alive to this day and lay followers of Dharmic religions think nothing of praying at each other&rsquo;s shrines. You will find many Hindus at the Golden Temple in Amritsar just as the streets of Bangkok are full of shrines dedicated to the Hindu god Brahma. The coronation of the king of Thailand is still carried out by Brahmin priests.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is likely that when Ashoka usurped the throne, he was opposed by family members who had links to the Jains and the Ajivikas. He may have responded by reaching out to their rivals, the Buddhists, for support. The power struggle may even explain his invasion of Kalinga. The mainstream view is that Kalinga was an independent kingdom that was invaded by Ashoka but there is some reason to believe that it was either a rebellious province or a vassal that was no longer trusted.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We know that the Nandas, who preceded the Mauryas, had already conquered Kalinga and, therefore, it is likely that it became part of the Mauryan empire when Chandragupta took over the Nanda kingdom. In any case, it seems odd that a large and expansionist empire like that of the Mauryas would have tolerated an independent state so close to its capital Pataliputra and its main port at Tamralipti. In other words, Kalinga would not have been an entirely independent kingdom under Bindusara &mdash; it was either a province or a close vassal. Something obviously changed during the early years of Ashoka&rsquo;s reign and my guess is that it had either sided with Ashoka&rsquo;s rivals during the battle for succession and/or declared itself independent in the confusion.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whatever the real reasons for attracting Ashoka&rsquo;s ire, a large Mauryan army marched into Kalinga around 262 BC. The traditional view is that the two armies met on the banks of the river Daya at Dhauli near modern Bhubaneswar. It is possible that Dhauli was the site of a skirmish but recent archaeological excavations point to a place called Yuddha Meruda being the site of the main battle followed by a desperate and bloody last stand at the Kalingan capital of Tosali.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The remains of Tosali were discovered only recently by a team of archaeologists led by Debraj Pradhan, a humble and affable man who has made some extraordinary discoveries about Odisha&rsquo;s ancient past. The site is at a place called Radhanagar, a couple of hours&rsquo; drive from Cuttack. It is situated in a broad fertile plain watered by the Brahmani river and surrounded by low hills. Surveying the beautiful valley from one of the hills, one is overwhelmed by a feeling of eternity &mdash; rice fields, fish ponds, coconut palms, mango trees, and thin wisps of wood smoke rising from village huts. Other than a few power transmission towers, the scene is perhaps close to what it would have looked to Mauryan generals planning their final assault.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The remains of the city&rsquo;s earthwork defences suggest that Tosali was built in the middle of the plains; arguably a poor choice as the city&rsquo;s defences would have been better served if they were wedged more closely to one of the hills. Archaeologists have only excavated a small section of the walls but have found it riddled with arrowheads; a blizzard of arrows must have been unleashed by the Mauryan army. The Kalingans never stood a chance. Ashoka&rsquo;s own inscriptions tell us that a 100,000 died in the war and an even larger number died from wounds and hunger. A further 150,000 were taken away as captives.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to the official storyline, Ashoka was horrified by his own brutality and became a Buddhist and a pacifist. But, as we have seen, he was already a practicing Buddhist by then, and from what we know of his early rule, he was hardly a man to be easily shocked by the sight of blood. The main evidence of his repentance comes from his own inscriptions. It is very curious, however, that this &lsquo;regret&rsquo; is mentioned only in locations far away from Odisha (such as in Shahbazgarhi in north-western Pakistan). None of the inscriptions in Odisha express any remorse; any hint of regret is deliberately left out.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Ashokan inscriptions at Dhauli are engraved on a rock at the base of a hill. Almost all tourists drive right past it to the white coloured modern stupa at the top of the hill. So I found myself alone with the inscriptions and the translations put up by the Archaeological Survey of India. What will strike anyone reading them is how they specifically leave out any sign of regret. The silence is deafening.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If Ashoka was genuinely remorseful, he would have surely bothered to apologize to the people whom he had wronged. Far from it, he doesn&rsquo;t even offer to free the captives. Even the supposedly regretful inscriptions include a clear threat of further violence against other groups like the forest tribes who are unequivocally &lsquo;told of the power to punish them that Devanampriya possesses in spite of his repentance, in order that they may be ashamed of their crimes and may not be killed&rsquo;. This is no pacifist.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is likely that Ashoka was using his inscriptions as a tool of political propaganda to counter his reputation for cruelty. As with the words of any politician, this does not mean he changed his behaviour. Moreover, many of the inscriptions are placed in locations where the average citizen or official of that time would not have been able to read them. Several historians including Nayanjot Lahiri have wondered about this. Is it possible that some of the inscriptions were really meant for later generations rather than his contemporaries?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Buddhist text, Ashoka-vadana, tells us of more acts of genocide perpetrated by the emperor many years after he supposedly turned pacifist. These were directed particularly at followers of the Jain and Ajivika sects; by all accounts he avoided conflicts with mainstream Hindus and was respectful towards Brahmins. The Ashoka-vadana recounts how Ashoka once had 18,000 Ajivikas in Bengal put to death in a single episode. If true, this would be the first known instance of large-scale religious persecution in Indian history (but, sadly, would not be the last).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is not the only incident mentioned in the text. A Jain devotee was found in Pataliputra drawing a picture showing Buddha bowing to a Jain tirthankara. Ashoka ordered him and his family to be locked inside their home and for the building to set alight. He then ordered that he would pay a gold coin in exchange for every decapitated head of a Jain. The carnage only ended when someone mistakenly killed his only surviving brother, the Buddhist monk Vitashoka (also called Tissa). The story suggests frightening parallels with modern-day fundamentalists who kill cartoonists whom they accuse of insulting their religion.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Supporters of Ashoka may claim that these incidents are untrue and were inserted into the story by fundamentalist Buddhist writers in much later times. While this is entirely possible, let me remind readers that my alternative narrative is based on exactly the same texts and inscriptions used to praise Ashoka. Perhaps the same scepticism should be evenly applied to all the evidence and not just to portions of the text that do not suit the mainstream narrative.</p>\n<section class=\"story_top_news\">\n<div class=\"news_photo\"><img src=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_800x600/HT/p2/2016/08/05/Pictures/_9426a422-5b2c-11e6-8ec9-11a86e94b7e9.jpg\" /></div>\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n</section>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to the references of his continued cruelty, we also have reason to believe that Ashoka was not a successful administrator. In his later years, an increasingly unwell Ashoka watched his empire disintegrate from rebellion, internal family squabbles and fiscal stress. While he was still alive, the empire had probably lost all the northwestern territories that had been acquired from Seleucus. Within a few years of Ashoka&rsquo;s death in 232 BC, the Satvahanas had taken over most of the territories in southern India and Kalinga too had seceded.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As one can see, Ashoka does not look like such a great king on closer inspection but a cruel and unpopular usurper who presided over the disintegration of a large and well-functioning empire built by his father and grandfather. At the very least, it must be accepted that evidence of Ashoka&rsquo;s greatness is thin and he was some shade of grey at best. Perhaps like many politicians, he made grand highminded proclamations but acted entirely differently. This fits with the fact that he is not remembered as a great monarch in the Indian tradition but in hagiographic Buddhist texts written in countries that did not experience his reign. He was &lsquo;rediscovered&rsquo; in the nineteenth century by colonial era orientalists like James Princep. His elevation to being &lsquo;Ashoka the Great&rsquo; is even more recent and is the result of political developments leading up to India&rsquo;s independence.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After Independence, it appears academic historians were further encouraged to build up the legend of Ashoka the Great in order to provide a lineage to Jawaharlal Nehru&rsquo;s socialist project and inconvenient evidence was simply swept under the carpet. This is not so different from how the medieval Ethiopians created a Biblical lineage for the Solomonic dynasty. A few Western writers like Charles Allen have patronizingly written how ancient Indians were somehow foolish to have had little regard for a great king such as Ashoka. On a closer look, it appears that they knew what they were doing. What is more worrying is how easily modern Indians have come to accept a narrative based on such minimal evidence.</p>\n</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/ashoka1475736088337.JPG","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecfa9234a4ac2d218b2215","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"indian ocean"},{"text":"ashoka"},{"text":"kalinga"},{"text":"india"},{"text":"religious persecution"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.hindustantimes.com/books/this-excerpt-from-a-new-book-demolishes-emperor-ashoka-reputation-as-a-pacifist/story-puxXlUpPsDy4TqELZ3UonN.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-06T06:41:48.457Z","udate":"2016-12-17T10:52:27.259Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f5f22c747fb76a42ef77b8","expirydate":null,"publishedOn":"2016-10-06T11:21:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out2515.mp3","priority":99999,"audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"indian ocean,ashoka,kalinga,india,religious persecution","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

It can lead to life-long complications, they say.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Many creams contain steroids and they can cause permanent damage to the skin from long-term use,&rdquo; Kuldeep Singh, Senior Consultant Plastic, Cosmetic and Reconstructed Surgery at Apollo Hospitals, New Delhi, told IANS.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said that healthy skin can be achieved regardless of complexion and that skin treatments cannot lead to lasting or permanent change in complexion.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Glutathione is a drug which has been advertised all over the Internet as a skin whitening agent. The truth is that glutathione is a very strong antioxidant present in our body which gets depleted with age or illness. The only scientifically-documented efficacy of glutathione injections is to reduce toxicity of certain anti-cancer drugs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;The rest is all vague, and not scientifically proven,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aakriti Kochar, beauty and make-up expert at Oriflame India, pointed out that skin-lightening creams can only lighten the melanin in the skin to a certain extent. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t drastically change one&rsquo;s skin colour.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;A lot of factors, depending on the treatment and quality of one&rsquo;s skin, determine the risk factors involved in such treatments. Overdoing these can lead to severe skin problems as melanin is lightened, causing more exposure to sun rays and skin quality might be affected, leading to depleting in layers,&rdquo; Kochar told IANS.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are many cosmetic brands which endorse skin-lightening and whitening creams, and indulge in blatant marketing to sell them. Of course, there are takers too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to market researcher AC Nielsen, in 2010, India&rsquo;s whitening-cream market was worth $432 million (Rs 2,600 crore). In 2012, Indians were said to have consumed 233 tonnes of skin-whitening products.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Two years later, the obsession with &ldquo;whiteness&rdquo; scaled a new level when a brand came up with a product designed to &ldquo;brighten&rdquo; the vagina.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The skin colour debate has time and again surfaced in the Indian and international cinema market. The latest instance involves acclaimed Indian actress Tannishtha Chatterjee, who has expressed outrage upon facing a &ldquo;racist attack&rdquo; on a nationally-televised comedy show, for mocking her dark skin tone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The actress is especially upset with how this deeply-rooted bias against colour has prevailed over the years.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Blossom Kochhar, Chairperson of the Blossom Kochhar Group of Companies, agreed that even in the 21st century, there seems to be no sign of a decrease in the number of people running after fair skin.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;People do not understand that to look beautiful, you need a glowing, clear and blemish-free skin. Not necessarily fair skin, as it does not symbolise beauty,&rdquo; Kochhar, a veteran in the Indian beauty industry, told IANS.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Stressing that skin-lightening solutions do not make one&rsquo;s skin fair but merely helps in brightening the skin, she added: &ldquo;We should appreciate beautiful skin and that should not depend on the complexion.

Read on for some simple and effective home remedies that will help you.","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e75bec71f6cb1a62d18","content":"<div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The much awaited festive season is here and people are busy ringing in the celebrations. Navratris and Durga Puja both entail lots of outings and family gatherings. It also means dressing and looking your radiant best. Now, therein lies the catch. While you&rsquo;ve been busy working and attempting to achieve work-life balance, very little attention was paid to the care of your beautiful skin.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Regimens went out the window and life took over. Till now, when you suddenly realise that there are a series of events and those dark circles and tired-looking skin are extremely irritating. But hold on, there is hope yet and it&rsquo;s pretty much your kitchen to the rescue.</p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr Deepali Bhardwaj, honorary dermatologist to the President Estate Clinic, has a number of ingredients that would help clean up your skin in record time (and within reason), giving it an instant glow and radiance. Now, isn&rsquo;t that perfect for your last-minute festive gorgeous look?</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>All skin types</strong>: Apply fresh lemon and tomato juice after washing your face. Wash it off after waiting for 10-15 minutes. Lemon contains citric acid which can change the pH value of the skin. The pH value determines the skin&rsquo;s acidity or alkalinity. Tomato juice contains coolants that soothe the skin and astringent properties that absorb the excess oil from the face. Hence, this pack will also help reduce acne.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Oily skin type</strong>: In the case of oily skin types, the pH level of the skin needs to be increased. Make a mixture of multani&nbsp;mitti (fuller&rsquo;s earth), rose water and lemon juice taken in equal proportions, and add a little honey to it. Apply the paste as a pack and wash after 15-20 minutes.&nbsp;Multani mitti and honey helps increase the pH of the skin, giving the face a radiant glow. Honey is a good moisturiser and contains soothing properties, thus, nourishing the skin.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"custom-caption\"><img class=\"wp-image-3066754 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/10/honey.jpg\" alt=\"Honey, lemon and curd contain skin cleansing properties that gives it a radiant glow.

Mix curd and honey in equal quantities and add a smaller portion of banana to it. Apply and wash it off in 10-15 minutes. Vitamin C, zinc and calcium in the curd make&nbsp;it a natural skin-care product. Banana contains lectin &mdash; a kind of proteins that destroy acne causing bacteria. Amino acid content in the fruit strengthens and nourishes the skin.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Sensitive skin type</strong>: Apply probiotic curd properly on the face as a pack and wash it off after 5 minutes.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most importantly, all these products are chemicals-free and are easily accessible. All of these products contains skin cleansing properties.

Striving to create an original inter-cultural show with French contemporary creation and Indian traditional dance and theatre, Mithuna is a fusion performance, mixing French and Indian worlds, to create a new artistic style.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mithuna is a Sanskrit concept that contemplates gender and sex, the sex of words, the sex of moments and the sex of beings. It is the conjunction of diversities, the jolting confrontation and contagion of differences, and their fertile and creative seeding. The choreography of Mithuna is devised to reflect upon the universal concepts of attraction and violence between genders, their metamorphoses, the joy and illusion of love, the eternal and necessary quest for understanding and harmony to bridge differences. It is performed by three artists, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Courvoisier, K Unnikrishnan Nair and Sadanam Manikandan and choreographed by Annette Leday from La Compagnie Annette Leday/Keli. Leday is the director and choreographer of La Compagnie Annette Leday/Keli, who specialised in inter-cultural contemporary creation, with a focus on dance and theatre traditions of India and France. After training as an actress in France, she journeyed to India in 1978, studying Bharatanatyam and Kathakali in Chennai. She then spent several years in rural Kerala, practicing and performing Kathakali with the Sadanam and Kalamandalam institutions.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">La Compagnie Annette Leday/Keli has become famous with their creation of Kathakali-King Lear.

Kumar, now 76, who played the baaj of the Maihar gharana for as long as he remembers was one of the 43 artistes awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award (Akademi Puraskaar) at the Rashtrapati Bhavan on Tuesday.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Other artistes include Hindustani classical vocalists Krishna Bisht, who is one of the foremost khayal exponents of the Dilli gharana, and Ustad Mashkoor Ali Khan, a significant torchbearer of the Kirana gharana gayaki, among others.

A young Manipuri girl when she first reached Delhi, Chandam has been called a &ldquo;chinki&rdquo;, pelted stones at by colony kids for looking different, and didn&rsquo;t feel included at work either. &ldquo;I think the only reason people accepted me here was because I picked up Hindustani and Urdu,&rdquo; says Chandam, 31.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is this love for her language, and her need to get Delhi to understand Northeastern culture that made Chandam come up with Wari, a storytelling project, in Delhi this June. &ldquo;Wari means story in Manipuri, and the aim is to bring folk tales from across the country and interpret them in Hindustani and Urdu,&rdquo; says Chandam.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At antiSOCIAL in Hauz Khas Village two weeks ago, four storytellers spent an evening doing just this. Meerut-based poet Azhar Iqbal recited Bewakoofon Ki Saltanat, his Urdu interpretation of one of AK Ramanujam&rsquo;s short stories. Theatre actor Abhinav Sabyasachi brought to the fore Kashmiri poet and mystic Lal Ded, intertwined with stories of Habba Khatoon, and other Kashmiri folk tales. and Anuja Jaiman presented a dramatic Manipuri tale, Houdong Lamboiba &ndash; The Monk Cat, leaving the audience in splits.&nbsp;The fourth storyteller, Nitin Sukhija narrated three tales spanning centuries and mythical eras, two of those tales written by himself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;When I came to Delhi from Imphal, I tasted freedom for the first time.

While that didn&rsquo;t work, she began Wari to get the stories out. &ldquo;Apart from folk tales, we want to bring post-modern literature to the stage too. Each chapter should be different from the other.

A new study published Thursday in the special issue of the Health Affairs Journal said the quality of health care depends mainly on where people live than who they are.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Researchers Jishnu Das and Aakash Mohpal, economists with the World Bank, Washington, surveyed more than 23,000 households in 100 villages of Madhya Pradesh and collected data between 2009 and 2011 on the quality of health care providers and primary care visits.&rdquo;We were able to study for the first time the key question of whether households that have low socio economic status in rural India receive lower quality care and if so by how much,&rdquo; Das, who is also a senior visiting fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, New Delhi told <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/\">The Indian Express</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The findings of the study &lsquo;Socioeconomic Status and Quality of Care in Rural India: New Evidence from Provider and Household&rsquo; show that where people live matters more than who they are. Striking evidence in this study population &mdash; the majority of which is poor and illiterate &mdash; shows that households can assess the quality of health care providers and actively seek out higher quality. When patients travel farther, they access higher quality care. Low socio-economic status households tend to travel farther than high socio-economic status ones to access the same quality care, the study found.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The study funded by the Global Health Program of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was conducted with the Center for Policy Research, New Delhi and the Institute for Socioeconomic Research on Democracy and Development in Delhi. &ldquo;The average village in our sample could access 11 healthcare providers and 49 percent of these providers had no formal medical training. Usage data are even more striking: 77 percent of all primary care visits were to providers without any formal medical training. Only 11 percent of all primary care visits were to the public sector and only 4 percent were to providers with an MBBS degree. Providers of average quality in our sample were able to correctly diagnose five key conditions 47.3% of the time and correctly treat these conditions 68% of the time. Because in some cases correct treatment could include &ldquo;referrals to a higher level&rdquo;, conditions could be correctly treated without a correct diagnosis,&rdquo; Das said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Providers with an MBBS degree had higher correct diagnosis and correct treatment rates, relative to those with alternate qualifications (AYUSH) and those without any medical training. When it comes to equity, there is a key difference between the &lsquo;village&rsquo; and the &lsquo;household&rsquo; as the unit of analysis. Low SES households living in low SES villages use low quality care. But low SES households living in high SES villages use higher quality care. In fact, if we compare low and high SES households living in the same village, we find no difference in the quality of care they receive, researchers have said.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/lowsocio_economic1475738978860.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecfadba2f5892d06478e2f","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"healthcare providers"},{"text":"ses"},{"text":"jishnu das"},{"text":"aakash mohpal"},{"text":"socioeconomic status and quality of care"},{"text":"global health program of the bill"},{"text":"melinda gates foundation"},{"text":"delhi"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/low-socio-economic-groups-travel-far-to-access-high-quality-health-care-study-3067981/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":true,"cdate":"2016-10-06T07:29:58.966Z","udate":"2016-10-06T07:55:05.607Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-06T07:27:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f5fd76747fb76a42ef7916","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out1520.mp3","priority":99999,"tagsForSearch":"healthcare providers,ses,jishnu das,aakash mohpal,socioeconomic status and quality of care,global health program of the bill,melinda gates foundation,delhi","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

From moisturising your damp skin to keeping yourself hydrated can make your life easy during cold season, says an expert.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rashmi Shetty, an aesthetic physician and a renowned dermatologist, shares precise solutions to ride out the ill effects of the impending winter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">* <strong>Keep yourself hydrated:</strong> The cold doesn&rsquo;t only dry out your skin, it attacks from within. Drink lots of water to keep your skin hydrated and healthy as it wards off all the toxins out of the system.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">* <strong>Exfoliate your skin regularly:</strong> Use a scrub made of curd and sugar to gently exfoliate your body and remove the layer of dead cells formed on it. Curd is known as a wonderful exfoliator for the skin due to the presence of lactic acid that provides soothing and hydrating effect to the skin, making it supple and nourished. Sugar, on the other hand, is a natural source of glycolic acid that penetrates the skin and breaks down the &lsquo;glue&rsquo; that bonds skin cells.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">* <strong>Moisturise over damp skin:</strong> The key to glowing skin is moisturising from head to toe. Extra care and conditioning can help your skin brave the chill.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">* <strong>Use a good sunscreen:</strong> During winters, most of us love basking in the mild heat of the sun to beat the chills. But, one common mistake that everyone makes is missing out on a sunscreen. The winters do not stop the UVA and UVB rays of the sun from harming your skin.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">* <strong>Ideal method for hair removal:</strong> Waxing and use of creams are a complete no no. Waxing is time consuming as well as messy. On the contrary, shaving when done right is favoured and faster. Waxing is said to strip off essential oils and natural lipids that are crucial for keeping your skin smooth. It makes skin more susceptible to dryness and peeling.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/winter_759_pixabay1475739495873.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecfadba2f5892d06478e2f","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"winter ushers"},{"text":"season"},{"text":"skin care"},{"text":"moisturising"},{"text":"damp skin"},{"text":"cold season"},{"text":"hydrated"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/bid-adieu-to-your-winter-blues-3067028/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":true,"cdate":"2016-10-06T07:38:35.553Z","udate":"2016-10-06T11:16:08.602Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-06T07:36:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f5ff7b081e826a78e80a28","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6682.mp3","priority":99999,"tagsForSearch":"winter ushers,season,skin care,moisturising,damp skin,cold season,hydrated","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Take a long, slow breath. Really, it'll help.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The idea that breathing exercises can somehow calm you down is an ancient one -yoga isn't a recent development, you know. But few people understand exactly how breathing can relieve stress on a physiological level and can even be used to increase workplace productivity .</p>\n<div class=\"last6brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The answer lies in the autonomic nervous system, which is responsible for the automatic functions that keep our body ticking. While most autonomic functions -such things as heart rate and digestion -are out of our conscious control, breathing is unique in that we can take charge, if desired. Not only that, but invoking different breathing patterns can have a sort of cascade effect, shif ting our entire autonomic nervous system between a state of rest and relaxation (scientists call this zone the \"parasympathetic\" state) and the ready-to-rumble state of fight-or-flight (this is called the \"sympathetic\" state).</div>\n<div class=\"last4brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />In layman's terms, different breathing patterns can serve as a quick and often easy way to manipulate your emotional and physiological state in ways that allow you to be calmer, less stressed, and more productive. Our lungs are filled with receptors that tell our brains whether we are inhaling or exhaling, explained Dr.Patricia Gerbarg, an assistant clinical professor in psychiatry at New York Medical College and co-author of The Healing Power of the Breath. As we inhale, we activate the sympathetic state (the fight-orflight system). As we exhale, we activate the parasympathetic state (the calm and collected system). This is why yogastyle breathing exercises often involve long exhalations.</div>\n<div class=\"last2brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />\"For maximum productivity, you want to breathe in a way that will keep you in the parasympathetic zone so you are calm and stress-free, but not too far into it to the point where your mind is mush,\" Gerbarg said. To achieve offi ce zen, Gerbarg suggests a breathing practice called Coherent Breathing, which features equal-length inhalations and exhalations at a very slow pace, without holding your breath. For most adults, the ideal breathing rate is four and a half to six full breaths per minute1. According to Gerbarg, this technique is ideal because it strikes a balance between the benefits of both the parasympathetic and sympathetic states and can be done with little effort after a bit of training. Studies have also linked it to a reduced stress and increased cognitive performance.</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/images1475741485537.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf22bea63af2cd0d81cda","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"slow breath"},{"text":"breathing exercises"},{"text":"yoga"},{"text":"stress"},{"text":"physiological level"},{"text":"heart rate"},{"text":"digestion"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/Slow-down-breathing-to-speed-up-your-work/articleshow/54710398.cms","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":true,"cdate":"2016-10-06T08:11:44.422Z","udate":"2016-10-06T11:15:39.425Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-06T08:08:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f60740081e826a78e80ac3","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out4478.mp3","priority":99999,"tagsForSearch":"slow breath,breathing exercises,yoga,stress,physiological level,heart rate,digestion","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Doyle&rsquo;s six-year journey of rejection before his first book was published, Tuesday morning was filled with animated discussions for the students of Sanskriti School as they met three of the country&rsquo;s most celebrated fiction writers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The session titled &mdash; &ldquo;EPIC&rdquo;URIOUS &mdash; Interpreting the mythological tales &mdash; which the school organised in association with Westland Books and Book World saw the three writers discuss their work which draws largely from Indian mythology and marries history and science fiction to it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While each writer accepted that they depend largely on mythological texts and characters, each one admitted to a different style of writing and thinking. For example, unlike Amish who has read and studied Indian mythology and is now presenting his own interpretation of the stories, Doyle said his style is inspired by a lot of Western authors who wrote about mythology using science. &ldquo;These are not just myths but a lot of science is involved. And I thought we have so many interesting stores in our culture. So I started research &mdash; can we use science to explain mythological secrets like mortality. Interestingly I found that there is a way to explain it,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Similarly, Sanghi spoke of his fascination about the overlap between history and myth but admitted that, like Amish, he is presenting old wine in a new bottle.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Each author outlined the number of rejections they had faced before their first book got published. While Amish said he had to self publish his book, Sanghi joked that his book was rejected by every literary agent, including those representing children and culinary books. &ldquo;I completed my first book in 2008 but it didn&rsquo;t get published until 2016. It was because I wanted to be an international author, so I ruled out Indian publishing houses and sent it to 17 to 18 literary agents abroad who rejected it as the central character was Indian,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Asked about the critic&rsquo;s reaction to their books, both Amish and Doyle shared painful experiences where the first was told to go back to banking while the latter, who had spent two years in research, was faulted for not researching enough for his book. &ldquo;My first review appeared in the US where basically the writer said it was a good book had it stopped on Page 10,&rdquo; said Sanghi.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/book-launch-7591475752674458.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecfadba2f5892d06478e2f","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"author"},{"text":"amish tripathi"},{"text":"ashwin sanghvi"},{"text":"christopher c. doyle"},{"text":"book"},{"text":"fiction writers"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/books/amish-sanghvi-doyle-in-epicurious-powwow-with-kids-at-sanskriti-school-3065692/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-06T11:18:13.746Z","udate":"2016-10-06T11:21:32.926Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-06T11:17:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f632f54702384640432312","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out7789.mp3","priority":99999,"tagsForSearch":"author,amish tripathi,ashwin sanghvi,christopher c. doyle,book,fiction writers","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

He was giving the task of delivering a sacred sword to another monastery. His journey was a test of his ability to use the knowledge that his years of commitment and dedication and study had given to him. His journey took him along a wild and desolate road. Up hill and down dale through thicket and swamp. <br /><br />The young monk traveled with time to think or to practice awareness. It was in the late morning when he first became aware that he was being followed by three very disreputable strangers. He was becoming concerned about the safety of the sacred sword encrusted as it was with silver and gold. But then he remembered an old Zen tale about strangers being friends not yet met. And as he thought about it His fears dissolved and when he stopped for his midday meal and the strangers joined him, he found them full of joy and questions about his knowledge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\">As the four set out on the trail that afternoon the young monk could not help but think about the old Zen tale about a farmer, who thinking his neighbor's son a thief saw a thief in the boy's every movement but upon finding his lost axe under a pile of straw, saw his neighbor's son transformed into an honest lad once more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\">That evening as they ate their meager meal the monk's new friends became insulting and quarrelsome. But he remembered an old Zen tale about a Zen warrior who would impress potential opponents with his skill by picking flies out of the air with his chopsticks and by impressing potential opponents and in this way would avoid unnecessary fights.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\">With this in mind the young monk focused his attention on a fly that was buzzing around his head and at just the right moment reached for the fly with his chop sticks. At which moment one of the thieves, not knowing any old Zen tales, cut off his head and stole the sword.</span></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/17875890-cartoon-hand-drawing-buddhist-monks-ritual-Stock-Vector1475755740041.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"knowledge"},{"text":"wisdom"},{"text":"bookish knowledge"},{"text":"worldly wise"},{"text":"zen"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.story-lovers.com/listszensufistories.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-06T12:09:06.011Z","udate":"2016-10-06T12:09:06.011Z","expirydate":"2016-12-31T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-05T18:30:00.000Z","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f63ee24702384640432397","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out9732.mp3","priority":99999,"tagsForSearch":"knowledge,wisdom,bookish knowledge,worldly wise,zen","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Why bettors zeroed in on Alexievich remains a bit of a mystery, given that the Nobel <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/nonfiction-deserves-nobel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tilts heavily toward fiction</a> and Alexievich&rsquo;s books are oral histories that combine fiction and non-fiction.

But it shouldn&rsquo;t be trusted, not really, since so far people are betting on the same writers that they always bet on to win the Nobel Prize, most of whom don&rsquo;t even have a chance. Pasta fetishist Haruki Murakami will not win the Nobel Prize. Bad tweeter Joyce Carol Oates will not win the Nobel Prize. The situation in Syria is so depressing that even the Nobel Committee for Literature, which loves to celebrate its own wokeness, won&rsquo;t touch it with a ten-foot pole, which means that the poet and perennial Nobel bridesmaid Adonis also probably will not win it. Kenyan writer Ngugi wa Thiong&rsquo;o might have a shot, but the point is this: Murakami, Oates, Adonis, and Ngugi have led the Ladbrokes field for years not because they are contenders necessarily, but because people bet on them.</p>\n<p>Why, then, do we always turn to Ladbrokes? Unlike the Man Booker or the National Book Award, the Nobel Prize releases no longlists or shortlists. Unlike political news, the information doesn&rsquo;t leak ahead of time&mdash;whatever else you can say about the Nobel Committee, they run a pretty tight Scandanavian ship. But that means that Nobel speculation rests entirely on bookies, and the bookies are not particularly confident in their ability to set the bets. The Nobel Prize may be the Super Bowl of literary prizes, but it&rsquo;s much harder to predict than the Super Bowl because seemingly anyone who has written a book could win it.</p>\n<p>Last year, a Ladbrokes representative emailed me to explain, &ldquo;We are very modest about our abilities to forecast events such as this, so we tend to let the market (i.e. our customer&rsquo;s money) be the guide as to where the odds should be.&rdquo; So the real reason the odds are so messed up&mdash;the reason someone who should delete their Twitter account is a perennial &ldquo;frontrunner&rdquo;&mdash;is because people tend to bet on popular international writers who seem Nobel-worthy or on those have been at the top of the Ladbrokes pile for years.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/saradanius1475758153053.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","publisherSectionName":"newrepublic.com","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"nobel prize"},{"text":"nobel-literature"},{"text":"top-secret shortlist"},{"text":"ladbrokes"},{"text":"swedish academy"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"https://newrepublic.com/article/137496/will-win-2016-nobel-prize-literature","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-06T12:49:18.939Z","udate":"2016-10-10T05:22:09.392Z","expirydate":"2016-10-11T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-06T12:42:00.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","publiseherSectionId":"57f6484e434eae4612608fad","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f6484e434eae4612608fac","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out4777.mp3","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"tagsForSearch":"nobel prize,nobel-literature,top-secret shortlist,ladbrokes,swedish academy","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

For instance, Shakespeare&rsquo;s oft quoted line &lsquo;To be or not to be&rsquo; is weaved from extremely lucid monosyllables. That is the mark of a true genius,&rdquo; observes critically acclaimed English writer of children&rsquo;s books Alan Gibbons, the man who issued a clarion call (in 2011) for the observance of National Libraries Day to celebrate reading for pleasure.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As he pays a visit to City Beautiful, to rekindle the reading-habit among children, we catch up for a candid interaction.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Books to be digested</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Coming over to the value of &lsquo;classics&rsquo; penned by masters of the art, Gibbons, who is currently busy writing his soon-to-hit-the-bookstores&rsquo; novel- &lsquo;They Saw Too Much&rsquo;, holds the view that, &ldquo;While it is pertinent to digest well the works (read classics) penned by the masters of their art, you must find a voice of your own.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He adds, &ldquo;In my understanding, Robert E Swindells and S.E. Hinton are the pioneers of young-adult fiction as we see it today. If you ask me to name one of the greatest children&rsquo;s book; a picture-book, in this case, it would have to be &lsquo;Where The Wild Things Are&rsquo; by Maurice Sendak. I admire how Sendak makes use of a handful of sentences in a brilliantly woven narrative. Also, I love &lsquo;Treasure Island&rsquo; by Robert Louis Stephenson.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Steer clear of prejudice</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He proudly terms himself as a writer of children&rsquo;s books, but by his own admission, that is not in the least to say that he is oblivious to the prejudices the society continues to harbour against the said realm. Halfway through the interaction, Gibbons candidly informs of his own accord, &ldquo;It is true. Writers of Children&rsquo;s literature continue to be underestimated. Some time back, there was this person who asked me what genre I write about and when I told him I write children&rsquo;s fiction; his response was- &lsquo;Oh, I thought you were a &lsquo;proper&rsquo; writer.&rsquo; Now isn&rsquo;t that appalling? &rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Establishing a connect</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, how does the 63-year-old Gibbons, establish a connect with his young readers? &ldquo;Well, literature taps on universal emotions. I put myself in the shoes of an adolescent, and sift through the dilemmas and loop of thoughts I went through when I was their age. I then refract it through the events of today to lend it the modern touch,&rdquo; responds the &lsquo;Forget Me Not&rsquo; author.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the conversation draws to a close, Gibbons peppers his signing-off line with an honest confession- &ldquo;Yes, writing is difficult and every writer would concur with that. There is this voice of God that you hear in your head and when you put those &lsquo;dreams&rsquo; to paper, at times it just does not feel right. But then, sifting the best out of it all is the key!&rdquo;</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/books1475758296250.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57bab99588ecdc7ead963796","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"manika ahuja"},{"text":"blue peter book award"},{"text":"alan gibbons"},{"text":"writers"},{"text":"books"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/life-style/say-less-mean-more/305366.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-06T12:51:55.517Z","udate":"2016-10-07T05:57:33.799Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-06T12:50:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f648eb434eae4612608fba","priority":99999,"publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6865.mp3","tagsForSearch":"manika ahuja,blue peter book award,alan gibbons,writers,books","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Our study not only pinpoints the root of the inaccuracy but also offers a way to get around it,\" said John Higgins, an associate professor at Harvard.<br /><br />The A1C test led to notable off-target estimates in about a third of more than 200 patients whose test results were analysed as part of the research.<br /><br />The team found these inaccuracies stemmed entirely from individual variations in the life span of a person's red blood cells.<br /><br />They calculated new, age-adjusted estimates and tested their predictive accuracy by comparing them to actual blood sugar levels measured directly via continuous glucose monitors wearable devices that read a person's blood sugar every five minutes.<br /><br />Incorporating the new model into existing tests, the researchers said, could lead to more precise diagnosis, monitoring and better-tailored treatments.<br /><br />Estimating a person's three-month blood sugar average is the best indicator of disease control and the most accurate predictor of looming complications, according to experts.<br /><br />Persistently elevated blood sugar can, over time, damage the heart, brain, kidneys, eyes, nerves and other organs.<br /><br />Since blood sugar varies by the hour and even by the minute, capturing \"an average\" to account for fluctuations over an extended period is a far better indicator of disease status than taking a \"snapshot\" measurement at one time.<br />The study appears in the journal Science Translational Medicine.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/574410_thump1475809493617.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baabc5ecbc9256e95c1763","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"blood sugar"},{"text":"harvard medical school"},{"text":"massachusetts general hospital"},{"text":"us"},{"text":"world health organization"},{"text":"journal"},{"text":"science translational medicine"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57ebc461b17dbb41078bbd0a","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/574410/method-accurately-measure-blood-sugar.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-07T03:04:59.746Z","udate":"2016-10-07T09:28:19.750Z","expirydate":"2016-12-08T22:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-06T18:30:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f710db339bda5d32978b6b","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out2821.mp3","tagsForSearch":"blood sugar,harvard medical school,massachusetts general hospital,us,world health organization,journal,science translational medicine","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

They also looked at how much these chemicals appeared in tobacco smoke and in smoke-free air.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As expected, cigarette smoke was more toxic than fumes from e-cigarettes, said senior study author Maciej Goniewicz of Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">E-cigarettes, however, had more toxic chemicals than smoke-free air, especially when the devices had higher power or voltage and when used with flavored liquid nicotine.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We found that strawberry-flavored product was the most toxic among all liquids we tested,\" Goniewicz added by email.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The researchers exposed human lung cells in a dish to smoke, e-cigarette vapors and air. The cells reacted most strongly to smoke, by reducing their metabolic activity and increasing output of inflammation-related chemicals. Similar, but not as strong, reactions were seen with e-cigarette vapor, compared to no change with plain air.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Past research has found that higher-voltage e-cigarettes produce a bigger nicotine jolt, but may also increase levels of dangerous chemicals like formaldehyde.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Our findings raise some concerns about the safety of additives used in e-cigarettes,\" Goniewicz said. \"If an e-cigarette user experiences any side effects, for example cough or chest pain, he or she should consider changing the flavorings in the product and operating their device in lower-power settings.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Big U.S. tobacco companies are all developing e-cigarettes. The battery-powered gadgets feature a glowing tip and a heating element that turns liquid nicotine and flavorings into a cloud of vapor that users inhale.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An international review of published research by the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews last month concluded that the devices could help smokers quit but said much of the existing evidence on e-cigarette safety was thin.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The current study doesn't offer a complete picture of e-cigarette safety or address the potential for health problems to emerge after long-term use, the authors note.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But it does suggest flavors may have an outsize impact on safety, the authors conclude in the journal Tobacco Control.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A separate study in the journal looked at cinnamaldehyde, a chemical added to liquid nicotine to create cinnamon flavors.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In lab tests of fluids from 39 refill cartridges of liquid nicotine, 20 contained enough cinnamaldehyde to damage cells, the study found. This included products labeled as cinnamon flavored as well as a variety of sweet and fruity mixtures.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here, too, the level of toxicity appeared greater with higher voltage devices.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We previously showed that cinnamaldehyde was highly toxic when tested in vitro with various types of cells,\" said senior study author Prue Talbot of the University of California, Riverside.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"In the new study, we further showed that cinnamaldehyde is much more widely distributed in e-cigarette products than originally thought and it appears in many sweet and fruity flavors, which are among the most popular,\" Talbot added by email.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/ecigratte1475815152158.jpeg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baab806a12cf7ee39133b8","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"e cigarettes"},{"text":"health and well being"},{"text":"flavours"},{"text":"nicotine"},{"text":"tobacco"},{"text":"menthol"},{"text":"inflammation"},{"text":"cell damage"},{"text":"roswell park cancer institute"},{"text":"new york"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/health-and-wellbeing/071016/flavouring-in-e-cigarettes-cause-more-health-problems-study.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-07T04:39:33.795Z","udate":"2016-10-08T08:17:48.010Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-07T04:38:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f727055c9c08595eb55613","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"publishedBy":"57dd1bc3fb61356b41a1bb60","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out5198.mp3","tagsForSearch":"e cigarettes,health and well being,flavours,nicotine,tobacco,menthol,inflammation,cell damage,roswell park cancer institute,new york","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

When the fever persists for more than 72 hours, a slew of diagnostic tests are prescribed to rule out dengue, swine flu, malaria and chikungunya.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fever Hospital superintendent Dr K. Shanker said, &ldquo;When fever persists for more than 72 hours, the symptoms have to be evaluated and tests carried out. According to the protocol, malaria comes first, followed by dengue due to its high prevalence. We don't test for all the diseases at the same time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most private hospitals do just that. A senior general physician said, \"If the fever persists for more than 72 hours, relatives ask why tests are not being done. They want to rule out all possibilities quickly. Hence, it&rsquo;s a double-edged sword where we can&rsquo;t ignore a single test because we want to wait and see what the test results of two or three diseases are.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Senior general physicians, who have been treating fevers, said that panic was being created deliberately. Dr G.V. Reddy, who practices at Lakdikapul, said, &ldquo;Once the patient goes to the hospital they are told about the increasing dengue, swine flu and chikungunya cases and that convinces them to opt for tests as they want to rule out all possibilities. The moot point is that once affected with high fever, and after taking medicines, it is important to rest. The rest factor is completely missing as the body is not being given a chance to heal.&rdquo;</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to hospital administration sources, those who have insurance are subjected to a lot of tests and patients are willing to take them as they know that they are covered.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ms Kavitha Vasvani, an insurance agent, said, &ldquo;Only in cases of reimbursement are the patients careful as they have to shell out a huge sum initially and reclaim it later. In such insurance covers, patients do not allow unwanted expenses and monitor the outgoings all the time.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fever is not covered in insurance policies, and hospitals therefore list the complications that could necessitate a stay in the hospital. There have been more than five lakh fever cases recorded in the state in the last three months and more than 60 per cent opted for treatment in private hospitals.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A senior government official said, &ldquo;We need to have proper government facilities in the existing units of public health centres and at the Fever Hospital to treat a simple thing like fever as many patients are being subjected to expensive treatment when they don't need to be.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Unnecessary tests, big bills</strong><br />Diagnosing fever profiles has become a huge business for diagnostic centres and hospitals. A fever profile, according to protocol, involves complete blood count, complete urine test, kidney function test and test for malaria parasite.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr Yadgiri Rao, senior general physician and member of the Indian Medical Asso-ciation said, &ldquo;These tests cost only `300 but that&rsquo;s not being done. Instead, on the very first day, for most patients, dengue, chi-kungunya and other tests are being carried out. Patients are charged `2000 to `3,500 for all these tests on the first day.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fever cases had increased after the recent floods and there was a beeline of patients to even the smallest of clinics in the city.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A senior doctor said, &ldquo;Whoever comes with very high temperature and complains of body ache, joint pains and a runny nose is sent for all tests.

The pathway offers a promising new target for developing a drug that would be effective in individuals for whom other antidepressants have failed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">New antidepressant options are important because a significant number of patients don't adequately improve with currently available anti-depressant drugs. The lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder is between 10 to 20 percent of the population.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The first author of the study Sarah Brooker said, \"Identifying new pathways that can be targeted for drug design is an important step forward in improving the treatment of depressive disorders.\" The aim of the study was to better understand how current anti-depressants work in the brain.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ultimate goal is to find new ones that are more effective for people not currently getting relief from existing drugs. In the study, scientists discovered for the first time that anti-depressant drugs such as Prozac and Tricyclics target a pathway in the hippocampus called the BMP signaling pathway.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A signalling pathway is a group of molecules in a cell that work together to control one or more cell functions. Like a cascade, after the first molecule in a pathway receives a signal, it activates another molecule and so forth until the cell function is carried out.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brooker and her team showed that Prozac and Tricyclics inhibit this pathway and trigger stem cells in the brain to produce more neurons. These particular neurons are involved in mood and memory formation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But the scientists didn't know if blocking the pathway contributed to the drugs' antidepressant effect because Prozac acts on multiple mechanisms in the brain. After confirming the importance of the BMP pathway in depression, the scientists tested a brain protein, Noggin, on&nbsp; depressed mice.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Noggin is known to block the BMP pathway and stimulate new neurons, called Neurogenesis. \"We hypothesized it would have an antidepressant effect, but we weren't sure,\" Brooker said. They discovered Noggin blocks the pathway more precisely and effectively than Prozac or tricyclics. It had a robust antidepressant effect in mice.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Scientists injected Noggin into the mice and observed the effect on mood by testing for depression and anxiety behavior. A sign of depression in mice is a tendency to hang hopelessly when held by the tail, rather than trying to get upright.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After receiving Noggin, mice energetically tried to lift themselves up, whereas control mice were more likely to give up and become immobile. The mice were then put in a maze with secluded (safe) and open (less safe) spaces.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Noggin mice were less anxious and explored more mazes than the control mice. \"The biochemical changes in the brain that lead to depression are not well understood, and many patients fail to respond&nbsp; to currently available drugs. Our findings may not only help to understand the causes of depression, but also may provide a new biochemical target for developing more effective therapies,\" said the other researcher.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The title of the paper is 'Hippocampal bone morphogenetic protein signaling mediates behavioral effects of antidepressant treatment' and was published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/depression1475816981758.jpeg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baab806a12cf7ee39133b8","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"anti-depression drugs"},{"text":"health and well being"},{"text":"mental health"},{"text":"the northwestern medicine"},{"text":"scientists"},{"text":"bmp pathway"},{"text":"neurogenesis"},{"text":"molecular psychiatry"},{"text":"sarah brooker"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/health-and-wellbeing/061016/scientists-come-up-with-new-way-to-ease-depression.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-07T05:10:03.222Z","udate":"2016-10-07T05:50:18.557Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-07T05:09:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f72e2bf807295d859fdaf2","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out4490.mp3","tagsForSearch":"anti-depression drugs,health and well being,mental health,the northwestern medicine,scientists,bmp pathway,neurogenesis,molecular psychiatry,sarah brooker","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

{"_id":"57f738d5f6280d58e8c2b66e","title":"Moved by the strength of black","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<div class=\"articleLead\">\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Bangalore-based, international sculptor-painter Yusuf Arakkal is no more. As someone who always responded with warmth and concern to his fellow beings, he often said that his art represented an &lsquo;anguished being who yearned for a meaningful existence&rsquo;, writes Pramila Lochan</h2>\n</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In a split instant Yusuf Arakkal had moved on leaving behind a poignant space. It was an ardent journey he had lived with determination, generosity and splendour. His life-time is a &lsquo;rags to riches&rsquo; saga that should certainly inspire many for whom his advise is &lsquo;stay afloat if you cannot swim but never drown&rsquo;. He is an artist who has crossed many landmarks from Chavakkad in Kerala to Bangalore, from a technical job at HAL to being a full-time artist, from the confines of aristocracy to living off footpaths and finally to owning a sprawling home-studio and a gallery in Brookefields in Bengaluru.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the art world he is remembered for his prolific works and as a renowned international artist, who has won the prestigious Lorenzo de Medici silver medal in 2003 for his triptych, &lsquo;War, Guernica re-occurs,&rsquo; and gold medal in 2006 for his painting 'Bacon's Man with the Child and Priest' at the Biennale Internazionale Dell&rsquo;Arte Contemporanea at Florence. Often one comes across artists recounting Yusuf&rsquo;s warmth and concern in sharing their angst and joys. As an individual and artist he was often moved emotionally by situations and humans conditions that transformed into works of art and as Yusuf stated it represented a &lsquo;anguished being who yearned for a meaningful existence&rsquo;. Man or woman on a canvas was a symbolic representation of the artist and framed into an abstract expression that moved towards the value and strength of black, a colour that he was inclined to use often in depicting enigmas of life.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A sculptor-painter by choice he chose a medium based on the expression he decided to work with. According to him, &lsquo;each medium had its limitations and possibilities. Stone had to be natural and cannot be made very fragile. In metal you have to create the strength and required lot of engineering. But if you work in oil it is a medium that is really flexible and has its disadvantages.&rsquo; His inclination for three-dimensional works is seen in paintings, sculpture and murals.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He was also a writer, philanthropist and an organiser. An alumnus of Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath he often took part in activities that promoted art awareness. In March 1996, Yusuf played an active role in planning a memorable week long All India artists&rsquo; camp in the premises of Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath, Bengaluru. Yusuf states in his catalogue note that, &lsquo;it was an idea born during an evening chat with his friends Kiran Mazumdar and John Shaw&rsquo;. It brought together some renowned artists of the country and served as a unique experience for art students and interested public who were allowed to observe artists at work. As an organiser and artist participant, Yusuf had shared the pressures of working amidst visitors and other responsibilities. &ldquo;I could begin my work on the canvas only on the third day. The first 10 minutes when you get your ideas focussed is the most difficult time. If there is any disturbance you cannot paint or carry on. After that I have no problem. I generally finish in 2 or 3 hours and larger the canvas, I work faster. The only problem is that in those few hours I get very involved after which I am totally exhausted and drained.&rdquo; There were evenings when Yusuf would prefer to write poems and as he had once said he used &lsquo;words as a medium of expression instead of colours or lines.&rsquo; Even as a young boy he was a voracious reader and deeply influenced by the writings of many Malayalam writers and specially Basheer. &lsquo;His colloquial language was very appealing, truthful and he was a very honest man. I was around 10-15 years around that time. My greatest ambition was to meet this man. I met him two years before his death and spent a lot of time with him. After his death I did a series of ten works based on him.&rsquo; On yet another occasion he sent 40 of his poems to well-known poet and author Kamala Das seeking her opinion. She chose 15 poems and wished him to publish them. Two of his poems &lsquo;Paper works&rsquo; and The Painter&rsquo; are posted on his website. Later during an exhibition held last year in Bengaluru, Yusuf created a portrait of Kamala Das representative of his admiration for her. The monochromatic portrayal of the poet attributes a sense of enigma that the poet lived with. &lsquo;Faces of Creativity&rsquo; was his last series that displayed 135 portraits of people he had worked with. Choosing to draw on the reverse side of a canvas with pen and ink the works remain a valuable legacy and anthology of Yusuf&rsquo;s creative expressions at Sara Art Gallerie.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>(Pramila Lochan is an art historian and writer based in Bengaluru)</strong></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/yusuf_bhai1475819712263.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babcefb210157e920b07f9","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"yusuf arakkal"},{"text":"war"},{"text":"guernica re-occurs"},{"text":"bacon's man with the child and priest"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/moved-by-the-strength-of-black/article9192936.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-07T05:55:33.913Z","udate":"2016-10-07T05:56:16.714Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-07T05:53:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f738d5f6280d58e8c2b670","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out4015.mp3","tagsForSearch":"yusuf arakkal,war,guernica re-occurs,bacon's man with the child and priest","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57f73a09f2efff597a395e49","title":"Casein point!","subtitle":"More than the cantata of colours, it is the poise and balance that define Velu Vishwanadhan works.","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">March 1998, artist Viswanadhan stood in front of his works at the NGMA, Delhi and said: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have a journey in painting if you don&rsquo;t have the ability to see beyond things. You must sustain a sensibility of observation. I learnt to find geometry and symbolism in the reservoir between the visible and the invisible.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">18 years hence, Paris-based Vishwanadhan&rsquo;s solo, &ldquo;Experience and Energy&rdquo; opens at Nature Morte Delhi. On view are 14 paintings spanning 25 years (1991 to 2016). Viswanadhan is unique for his medium &ndash; he uses casein, a paint made from proteins derived from milk. &ldquo;It is casein which gives Viswanadhan&rsquo;s works their mysterious glow and almost inner source of light,&rdquo; says Peter Nagy. &ldquo;Over the years, his colours as well as his compositions have been continually honed, resulting in painting in its perhaps most purified state.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Crimson Tide</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">You are swept into canvasses that are an anecdote of the spirit, realms of smoky toned crimson tide, it rides on the rhetoric of reflection, it plumbs the embers of instincts and intuitions and draws you into the nuances of &lsquo;indigenous modernism.&rsquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">For an artist who has worked arduously over five decades finding the depth of colourative chasms in casein these corollaries are born of meditative moorings, with resonant reds in ascendance.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Almost like a Thyagaraja kriti that carries in its womb the notes of winter waiting to bloom into the rapture of spring &ndash; it&rsquo;s a glimpse into a modern mandala. You think of the poojas done for the Bhagvathy, the flaming Theyyam dancers, you think of the <em>Chethi/ Thechi</em> flower used for the <em>Thechi undamala</em> (thechi garland) offered at the Guruvayoor Temple in Kerala. In this recurrent realm of chromatics we see a melding of mysterious and moody reverberations &ndash; a balance between Western abstraction and exploration of matter and meaning, synthesised into geometric harmonies of colour and luminosity.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">While you discern the sophistication of his sensibility you know that abstraction for Viswanadhan is more than colour, more than light that glows, it is the summation of an inward odyssey. And the geometry of the dipped in colour fields a sojourn &ndash; like a <em>raga alpana &ndash; </em>in early works the verdant green, leafy lyric is touched by a turmeric tone or hibiscus red that enchants (Untitled 1991 and 2001). In that melding, the capturing of light is enhanced by the resonant flow of experiences &ndash; colour is carried on the wings of evanescence.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Chords in harmony</strong></p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The crucibles of geometry and chromatic tones of works on the walls whisper the harmony of chords. Words diminish and a tantric tradition of auratic echoes deepen the rhythms of resonance. What is it about these colours? Viswanadhan allows the velvet timbred, wine toned crimsons to glow and fade, you want to breathe in hue after hue, when a warm yellow peeks (2001), it speaks of the sunrise on the sea. Sometimes, the rippling russets and verdant greens hint at tropical plants, sometimes the burnt sienna of the sunset (2005) that changes amidst seasons as it embraces the particles of sand. But more than the cantata of colours, it is the poise and balance that plays like a raga.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">What runs as a common thread over 25 years, is Viswanadhan&rsquo;s love for the rhythmic rise and fall of associations and memories that unravel like legendary lyrics in the lingua franca of the grammar of geometry bathed in colour. These works are deceptively minimal but maximal in intent &ndash; they have been through the prism of time, intricately storied and subverted in the contemplation of an inner world of individual emotions mirrored perfectly in a silent, yet supple, periodic perspective of inner harmonies.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Vishwanadhan has always maintained that an artist is an outsider. And this distance is one that lends perspective. He quotes James Joyce, &ldquo;I go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Perception of time</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">What does the viewer take back? Viswanadhan gives the viewer a subtle yet subconscious analysis of the perception of time. The essence of the strict geometry of forms tells us that structure is internally stratified in the mind of an artist. And within those layers is a fundamental layer of perceptual presence. It is born of the mosaic of a thousand experiences that have filtered through time. It has gone through the sieve of memory, associations, primitive practices in Indian expression born of an accumulation of inchoate experiences. Intriguing how the artist&rsquo;s perception is recreated through the energy of his &lsquo;act of seeing &rsquo;.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">At 76 years, Viswanadhan plays solitaire. The &lsquo;outsider&rsquo; artist reflects a voracious reader, a thinker, one who has continuously churned his thoughts within the wheel of inner inheritance. The artist&rsquo;s &lsquo;act of seeing &rsquo; becomes the abacus of his own language &ndash; it unravels the quality of surfaces as well as depths to which he explores his own incantations in expression. Literary allusions flow through translucent layers.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yet through the mandala of meanderings there exists a monochromatic melancholia, a resonant human effectiveness born of Dravidian living, red earth and copper sun. This show at Nature Morte Delhi is about how imperative the visible and invisible are in exploring the perceptual roots of metaphoric moorings. When Viswanadhan says, &ldquo;The void is essential for imagining things&rdquo; you know how experience is translated into a visual construct and how materiality can unfold within the odyssey of time. This artist stands tall in the practice of abstraction &ndash; his colour fields are expressions fused in the shift from visual to tactile perceptions.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">From the transparency of air to the grains of sand to the sombre density of velvet darkness he exemplifies the truth that &ldquo;material is the base of the spirit.&rdquo; And abstract master, Mark Rothko&rsquo;s words echo through the show: &lsquo;Silence is so accurate.&rsquo;</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/art1475820020419.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babcefb210157e920b07f9","publisherSectionName":"","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"artist"},{"text":"paintings"},{"text":"velu vishwanadhan"},{"text":"peter nagy"},{"text":"chethi/ thechi"},{"text":"thechi undamala"},{"text":"thyagaraja kriti"},{"text":"raga alpana"},{"text":"uma nair"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/casein-point/article9193582.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-07T06:00:41.678Z","udate":"2016-10-07T08:37:43.832Z","expirydate":"2016-10-06T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-07T05:58:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f73a09f2efff597a395e4b","publishedBy":"57f1fbdb38a70549f03f5fb4","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out8273.mp3","tagsForSearch":"artist,paintings,velu vishwanadhan,peter nagy,chethi/ thechi,thechi undamala,thyagaraja kriti,raga alpana,uma nair","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57f73adcb547d25d4f55b32f","title":"Winning performances","subtitle":"Variety and competence was clearly the highlight of the performances of five male dancers at Rasasvada","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was an evening dedicated to male dancers at &lsquo;Rasasvada&rsquo;, the dance festival organised by Nrityantar Academy of Performing Arts and in the course of three hours, five dancers-- Kohal Das, Dr. Sanjay Shantaram, Probal Gupta, Surya N. Rao and Parshwanath Upadhye presented solo recitals in their respective classical styles. The packed, mixed-bag sort of programme resembled the format of a relay race which could have been tiresome but luckily what worked in its favour was the fact that each dancer competently shouldered the responsibility for his bani and presented it with utmost care. The other aspect which made a difference was the kind of compositions that the dancers themselves chose- from simple devotional pieces to elaborate treatises- there was a variety that kept the audience on their toes.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kohal Das, a student of Madhulita Mohapatra, chose &lsquo;Jay Mahesha&rsquo;, a straightforward, traditional piece that pays obeisance to Shiva. A clarity of expression and a combination of grace and strength marked Das&rsquo; performance which albeit simple, left an impact. The vocabulary of a style is perhaps best visible in traditional pieces such as these and the ability to perform them to near-perfection is no mean feat either. The evening made a sudden shift from the suave mood that Das had created to a rather dramatic one that Dr. Shantaram brought on stage with his 'Ravana Patraparichaya', a traditional Kuchipudi performance presented in the Bhagavatha Mela idiom. Live music accompanied Shantaram&rsquo;s performance which delineated the different facets of Ravana. Blurring the lines between drama and dance, Shantaram tried his best to recreate the Bhagavatha mela setting using aspects such as vachika abhinaya, the use of the sutradhara and dramatic dialogue. This performance was deliberately melodramatic in nature. Probal Gupta presented a traditional padam wherein Krishna consoles the Pandavas as they prepare to leave for the forest. The arguments that Krishna uses form the crux of the piece and Gupta&rsquo;s Kathakali recital attempted portray them through dance. Gupta also projected a translation of the Malayalam lyrics which was more of a distraction unfortunately. The translation broke up words rather arbitrarily disregarding grammar and sentence construction too.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gupta&rsquo;s strength was in the pure nritta sequences where he adhered to the 16 matras of the <em>paddiniya chempada talam</em>. His abhinaya, however, seemed a bit disjointed often making it difficult for the audience to follow the narrative purely on the basis of his expressions. Surya presented a variety of compositions within his segment. He began with episodes from the Ramayana, followed by a piece on Ardhanarishwara and a pure abhinaya composition, <em>Priye Charusheele</em>. What strikes you first about Surya&rsquo;s dancing is his agility and flexibility. Sticking to the idiom of Kuchipudi, Surya also simultaneously showcased his prowess in choreography, especially through <em>Ardhanarishwara</em> and<em>Priye Charusheele</em> and one realised that abhinaya is Surya&rsquo;s stronghold. The best was indeed reserved for the last when Bharatanatyam dancer Parshwanath Upadhye came on stage. There is a certain unity in Parshwanath&rsquo;s performance which also gives his dancing a feeling of rootedness and a character of its own. This is also accompanied by remarkable stage presence and a sense of effortlessness. He first presented an <em>Amba Stuti</em> which was followed by his version of<em> Ardhanarisvara</em>. Clean lines, neat footwork and an abundance of energy marked Parshwanath&rsquo;s performance, which despite being shorter in length in comparison to the rest, managed to create an impact. It was a befitting finale to the evening&rsquo;s performances and reiterated one&rsquo;s belief in the fact that there can be no better substitute to good dancing after all.</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/dance1475820232196.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babcefb210157e920b07f9","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"parshwanath upadhye"},{"text":"surya n. rao"},{"text":"probal gupta"},{"text":"sanjay shantaram"},{"text":"kohal das"},{"text":"nrityantar"},{"text":"madhulita mohapatra"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/winning-performances/article9193037.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-07T06:04:12.805Z","udate":"2016-10-07T08:38:15.277Z","expirydate":"2016-12-31T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-07T06:03:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f73adcb547d25d4f55b331","publishedBy":"57f1fbdb38a70549f03f5fb4","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out2319.mp3","tagsForSearch":"parshwanath upadhye,surya n. rao,probal gupta,sanjay shantaram,kohal das,nrityantar,madhulita mohapatra","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Birju Maharaj, Kelucharan Mohapatra and Madhavi Mudgal, Pawrati Dutta has carved a niche for herself in the world of classical dance. Her passion for Kathak, especially Dhrupad, has led her to dig deep into the history of this form, which she now shares with young, budding dancers.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">This versatile dancer, was in Bengaluru for a five-day workshop for senior dancers. She talks to Friday Review about her passion for the form, especially Dhrupad. Parwati has also been instrumental in setting up Mahagami Gurukul, in Aurangabad, where she has been spearheading dance training and sensitisation programmes in some of the remotest pockets of the country. That is not all she has also taken dance to prisons, to encourage inmates to take to dancing. She started learning when she was a teen and Parwati goes back in time to share her journey through dance.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Excerpts:</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>You have learnt Odissi and Kathak, did the two styles not clash with each other? They are so different in style....</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Odissi has always been my search. I find Kathak and Odissi very similar, especially the Kathak that I do &ndash; the <em>thhat, uthaan</em> , the pure dance and the dhrupad &ndash; are all so lyrical. It is we have who have changed Kathak to become a rhythmically charged form. But I feel the soul of Kathak is still lyrical. It is like the Khadi fabric, subtle and beautiful. Learning two dance forms is like learning two languages. When you know your mother tongue and learn a new language, you rediscover your own language. The same way Odissi has helped me analyse Kathak better. I find myself more educated as I can pinpoint subtle movements in the body.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What do you feel about such workshops, which teach not just the dance form but also its rich history? Should there be more such as holistic efforts?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">They are not done these days. This is my first trip to Bengaluru, where I have come to ignite young minds. It is a process-oriented and not a result-oriented workshop. This is my way of sharing my years of research and study with younger dancers. Majorly workshops are shallow.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">I don&rsquo;t believe in the rat race, even when it comes to having a number of students. Instead, I left it -- moved out of Delhi where I was thriving to Aurangabad to work with Mahagami.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Tell us more about Mahagami.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was there from the time of its inception. It&rsquo;s been 20 years since it started. I feel I was destined to go there and work with the marginalised people. It was a random decision. It was a stretch of a barren land. I was discouraged when I was invited to teach there. But I took it up as a challenge.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was the beginning of a new story in my life and for many others. Now it has grown. The saplings that were planted by me are now part of a lush green campus. Over the years I have trained over 2,000 dancers. Aurangabad was not ready for Mahagami. So I had to counsel the parents and help them understand the nuances and the rich history of Kathak.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What do you mean when you say a dancer has to have the responsibility towards the form?</strong></p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">To realise that the dance has to nurture you and your individualistic expressions. But the responsibility has to pass on to the next generation in all your honesty.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you buy a car, you plant a tree. These are rules you have to set for yourself. We still have to consult experts, learn from them and pass on the rich heritage for generations to come.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">***</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Perfect moves</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The recently-held workshop by Parwati Dutta covered many historical and social nuances of Kathak</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A long drive took us to IGNCA (Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, Southern Regional Centre), where renowned Kathak dancer -- Parwati Dutta &ndash; concluded her intense week-long workshop for senior students in the city.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Organised by Gramsci Foundation, a Bengaluru-based Art trust and IGNCA, the workshop had around 12 students who tried to imitate her moves.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">They start off by reciting the taals verbally and then try to recreate the same rhythm with their feet. The tempo goes from slow to fast. Soft-spoken Parwati is a task master. She makes her students repeat the moves till she is satisfied with every look, footwork and the final hand gesture. The workshop was not just dance, but also about the legacy of Kathak. &ldquo;It is a very subtle form,&rdquo; she says gesturing her students to sit down for a while. &ldquo;Kathak is just like cooking that perfect meal. You cook with love. Even adding one pinch of extra salt can ruin the taste. Similarly, there need not be any exaggerated moves.&rdquo; She cites the example of a tiny leaf swaying softly in a light breeze. &ldquo;That leaf moving has its own significance. The beauty lies in that subtlety,&rdquo; she adds.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;When I was young, we would take our books and pens as we would learn so much from each festival. We had festivals dedicated to only dhrupad or khayals. So we would have many Kathak dancers, who would come and present their choreographies on these.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Did you know that the first reference of kathak was in the Mahabharat? It clearly indicates that it was a story telling form, performed by scholars and teachers and was essentially a male art for centuries,&rdquo; explains the dancer, who calls herself a devotee of dhrupad and has researched on how Kathak was performed by Dhrupad practitioners in the early centuries.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She blames Bollywood for &ldquo;ruining our classical dances and reducing Kathak as a dance of the courtesan. It was a social problem, where every dance form suffered. Now, after 70 years of Independence I still find that our dance forms are not liberated from these pathetic views.&rdquo;</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/kathak14758203673971475829695552.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babcefb210157e920b07f9","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"parwati dutta"},{"text":"kathak"},{"text":"odissi"},{"text":"mahagami gurukul"},{"text":"dhrupad"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/finding-beauty-in-subtlety/article9192976.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-07T06:06:28.645Z","udate":"2016-10-07T08:41:43.968Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-07T06:05:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f73b64f6280d58e8c2b68b","publishedBy":"57f1fbdb38a70549f03f5fb4","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6641.mp3","tagsForSearch":"parwati dutta,kathak,odissi,mahagami gurukul,dhrupad","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Ranjani Govind speaks to the author","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Mysore Wodeyar dynasty, beginning with Maharaja Yaduraya in 1399, patronised art, culture and music. The last in the line, the 25th king, the late Jayachamaraja Wodeyar distinguished himself as a Carnatic musician, a piano player and a composer.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jayachamaraja Wodeyar composed 94 kritis in 94 different ragas in a short span of 28 months from August 1945 to December 1947. He is said to have invented 10 new ragas and popularised 30 rare scales. It is only in the past 15 years some of his compositions were made available by vocalist and musicologist (late) S. Krishnamurthy (grandson of Mysore Vasudevachar who was guru to the Maharaja). It was more than three decades after the Maharaja&rsquo;s death in 1974, in 2006 that Krishnamurthy&rsquo;s compilation of all the 94 compositions along with notations was available. The author was present when Vasudevachar was imparting lessons to his royal disciple and the work thus gets rare authenticity.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A decade later, this year, the Maharaja&rsquo;s kritis have been brought out with explanations, background and categorisations by a Mysuru musicologist and vainika V. Nanjundaswamy. Close scrutiny and analyses of the Maharaja&rsquo;s kritis make up the 468-page book, &lsquo;Royal Composer Shri Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar.&rsquo; It contains word-to-word meaning with a comprehensive study of all the 94 compositions with extensive information on the Maharaja&rsquo;s study of sacred scriptures and mythology.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nanjundaswamy has given the work a new dimension by looking at the compositions as those of a Sri Vidya upasaka, which the king was. &ldquo;This is why the Maharaja&rsquo;s ankita, or the signature is &lsquo;Sri Vidya&rsquo; in all his compositions as he was also a follower of Mysore Chamundeswari Devi, his family deity,&rdquo; observes Nanjundaswamy.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I took nearly 20 years to do this kind of a compilation which is rare,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;As a 20th century composer, Jayachamaraja Wodeyar was the only one to give us 11 kritis on Lord Ganesa in Sanskrit,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The nine Sri Vidya kritis of the Maharaja relates to the Aavaranas of Sri Vidya. &ldquo;Take the Maand raga kriti, &lsquo;Brahmaanda Valaye&rsquo; or &lsquo;Srichakra pura nivasini&rsquo; in Suddha Lalitha that explains his scholarly take,&rdquo; points out Nanjundaswamy.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hamsa Vinodini, Prathapa Varali, Nagadhwani, Suranandini and Durvanki are some of the ragas credited to the Maharaja. Among the taalams is Khanda Jhampa.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Maharaja&rsquo;s inclination for composing started off with &ldquo;Sri Mahaganapatim Bhaje Hum&rdquo; (Atana) in 1945, with almost the rest eulogising his family deity Chamundeswari.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;The end of 1947 saw the 94th, his last, kriti &ldquo;Sriranganatha&rdquo; gain form in Kalyana Vasantha,&rdquo; says Nanjundaswamy.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;My aim is to see that the kritis reach people with the right background and perspective. This way, the persona of the last Maharaja who reigned from 1940 to 1950 is mirrored,&rdquo; says Nanjundaswamy. Given the background of Nanjundaswamy as a regular visitor to the Palace, the book is pepped up with interesting details. His uncle M. Chaluvarayaswamy was an Asthana Vidwan of the Royal Court, and his father served as the manager of the palace temples for nearly six decades.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;As the king presented his compositions to Vasudevachar and discussed the lyrics, sangatis and ragas, Krishnamurthy would be sitting at a distance noting every detail,&rdquo; says Nanjundaswamy. &ldquo;I would meticulously present the same the next day, while the king would further revise it and give it a final shape,&rdquo; Krishnamurthy had told Nandundaswamy.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">What makes Wodeyar&rsquo;s work rich is his chaste Sanskrit lyrics clothed in ragas and talas noticeably different.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;The king once brought in an invigorating blend of Madhyamavati and Udaya Ravichandrika and called it &lsquo;Shuddha Salavi.&rsquo; He realised that something was missing. Vasudevachar advised him to avoid oscillations at the rishabha and gandhara as &lsquo;the flattened phrases would lend it a personality.&rsquo; The proof is in his composition, &ldquo;Sugyana Daayaneem Vandey.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nanjundaswamy, a retired bank employee and recipient of Karnataka Kalashree, has even classified the Maharaja&rsquo;s works with finer distinctions as Ganesa, Lakshmi and Devi compositions. &ldquo;Wodeyar&rsquo;s inclination to Western music also had him choose the Dheera Shankarabharana scale for more than 30 kritis as it is close to Western Major Melodic scale,&rdquo; says the author.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Paeans to Chamundi</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;The Maharaja has written 57 kritis on Devi, including five on Mahalakshmi, and two on Saraswati, says well-known vocalist of Mysuru, Sukanya Prabhakar, who holds a doctorate in Jayachamaraja Wodeyar&rsquo;s kritis. She has released a five-part audio CD, &ldquo;Sri Vidya Vaggeya Vaibhava&rdquo; containing 42 of his songs. There are seven compositions on Chamundeswari, of which &lsquo;Chintayami Jagadamba&rsquo; in Hindolam, was popularised by M.S. Subbulakshmi. Ariyakkudi Ramanuja Iyengar delighted the ruler by singing &lsquo;Chintayami Jagadamba&rsquo; in his Durbar concert. &ldquo;Those days musicians made it a point to render songs of contemporary vaggeyakaras. Otherwise, Jayachamaraja Wodeyar&rsquo;s songs wouldn&rsquo;t have come to light, given his aversion to publicity,&rdquo; says Sukanya.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/07FRJAYACHAMARAJA__3035725g1475821242165.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf66aebfe246bd8ebdfe5","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"nanjundaswamy"},{"text":"book"},{"text":"compositions"},{"text":"jayachamaraja wodeyar"},{"text":"chamundeswari"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/history-and-culture/nanjundaswamys-book-is-on-the-compositions-by-jayachamaraja-wodeyar-about-chamundeswari/article9193150.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-07T06:21:03.565Z","udate":"2016-10-07T09:41:33.023Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-07T06:20:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f73ecf4a8d835943bd2d8f","publishedBy":"57dd191afb61356b41a1bb48","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6761.mp3","tagsForSearch":"nanjundaswamy,book,compositions,jayachamaraja wodeyar,chamundeswari","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Santhanagopalan, a popular and veteran musician in the field, got connected to the knowledgeable music lovers in this area of East Delhi no sooner than he started his concert. Indeed, it turned out to be a delightful evening of Carnatic music, both for the audience as well as the artistes.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Santhanagopalan started his concert with the Adi Tala Varnam &ldquo;Inta Chalamu&rdquo; in the raga Begada in two speeds in a befitting manner. The invocation song on Lord Ganesha was Muthuswami Dikshitar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Panchamatanga&rdquo; in raga Malahari. The song was suffixed with detailed kalpanaswaras. For the Tyagaraja&rsquo;s composition &ldquo;Telisi Ramachintanato&rdquo; in raga Poornachandrika, which Santhanagopalan took up subsequently, he introduced neraval and kalpanaswaras.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Santhanagopalan also sang Tyagaraja&rsquo;s &ldquo;Eti jenmamidi&rdquo; in raga Varali and &ldquo;Bagayanayya&rdquo; in raga Chandrajyoti in an emotive manner bringing out the emotive contents of the lyrics to the fore. He also sang the slow pace Muthuswami Dikshitar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ranganayakam&rdquo; to a riveting tempo and in a delightful manner.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Being in the midst of Navratri festival, as expected, Santhanagopalan&rsquo;s central item of recital was on Goddess Devi. The choice of Muthuswami Dikshitar&rsquo;s navavarana kriti &ldquo;Kamalambam Bhajare&rdquo; in raga Kalyani was thoughtful. Till then, though there was a sumptuous quota of compositions, the raga alapanas were not. The only raga alapana that came in for detailed delineation was Kalyani. Sadly, many phrases in the delineation were a mere swara combinations and these did not quite help in bringing out the complete features of the raga to the fore.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Delhi R. Sridhar on the violin, Kumbakonam N. Padmanabhan on the mridangam rose to the occasion and provided good support. N.

He has made a name for himself in the field of Natya Sangeet too. With his exposure of learning under such learned gurus, Dhananjay claims to have developed a gayaki, essentially his own.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Accompanied on tabla by Mahesh Kanole and Devendra Varma on harmonium, Dhananjay opened his concert with raga Yaman, the most popular and melodious raga of the evening. Preceded with a brief introductory aalap, the traditional composition of Sadarang &ldquo;Mero man baandh lino...&rdquo; set to slow Ektala; was given a reposeful and methodical handling with detailed Aalap-Barhat in gradual progression of the swaras till he reached the Taar Shadj and delineated the antara with the same restraint. It was followed by forceful sapat and sargam Taans, released with refreshingly executed melodic sequences.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The chhota khayal was a lovely composition of Ustad Aman Ali Khan of the Bhendi bazar gharana, &ldquo;sugam roop suhane&hellip;&rdquo; set to the lyrical gait of addha theka and yet another composition of Pandit C.R. Vyas with whom Dhananjay had studied for a short stint. The dynamic mukhda of this composition &ldquo;Eri na maane Piya...&rdquo; was adorned with quicksilver taans. Dhananjay, in fact, seemed to have the choicest collection of compositions (bandishes) from all over; which was evident also in his next rendition of khayals and even the concluding bhajan.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Equally commendable was his choice of Bageshri for the next raga, delineated with delightful melodic sequences that sustained the ragas&rsquo; basic character throughout the multiple compositions of different flavours. The first composition &ldquo;Ritu basant tum apni umang so...&rdquo; set to addha theka of Trital; was rendered in a reposeful manner while the second one &ldquo;Jo hamne tumse baat kahi&hellip;.&rdquo; in Teentala, showcased his playful rhythmic demeanour and the third &ldquo;Na daro rang mope...&rdquo; set to drut Ek-tala had the flourish of colourful fast taans, as if sprayed through the pichkari, mentioned in its lyric.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dhananjay rounded off his impressive recital with a bhajan with a lovely lyric in &ldquo;Sur charachar chhayo / ghat ghat tumba bana usi ka, aiso naad jagayo...&rdquo; based on raga Bhathiyar redolent with an aroma of emancipation; reminiscent of the Nirgun bhajans of Kumar Gandharva. The melodic touches of harmonium and the appropriate tabla sangat enhanced the stature of his recital.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">With the aim to encourage talented young musicians from across the country, the India International Centre (IIC) has been hosting them in classical music concerts on a regular basis.

When the glowing mid-day sun, the idle well-side, the content cows chewing cud, the dragonflies swinging in mid-air, the calves staring at them with wide and blinking eyes, and the people dozing after a hearty meal, had all blended in the total silence, what could a solitary crow do?</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As she listened to the crow, Lalitha felt that its cawing too faded to blend with the silence.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She took out the betel leaf box and began to arrange the tender green leaves.

She would know only when he returned home. Even then she would get her answer not by a direct response from him, but when Subbarayan learnt a new composition from him the next day. If it was a new song about Bangaru Kamakshi, it meant that it was composed while he was lost in Kamakshi in her temple. If he had gone to Tiruvaiyaru, the song would be different. Tyagayyar&rsquo;s devotion, his simple, guileless emotional outpourings and his music would be discussed with admiration. This beauty, the appreciation and the depth of devotion were details which blended with one another with certainty, but her life was an enigma. Thoughts and imagination budded and blossomed forth in her heart too, like shadowy figures, but never did she experience the joy of pouring them forth. What could one share with a person who came home already brimming with the ecstasy of experience?</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">If artistes could be graded as great and small, then she was a small artiste, thought Lalitha. Aching with the unexpressed beauty inside her, she asked him one day.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it have been wonderful if I could sing too?&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Whatever I sing is only for you,&rdquo; he said. She could even now at this moment recapture the way he looked at her deeply, and the touch of his loving fingers stroking her head&hellip; but to live mostly in memories and sparingly in reality? She could not get used to this as she had got used to hunger&hellip;!</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She heard the rear fence being moved open.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dharma... She already felt exhausted. Now she must brace herself for a series of probing questions from her friend, that bore into her like a bee.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Lalitha, have you not eaten yet?&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dharma asked, assessing the situation by a glance into the kitchen.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&lsquo;No&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Has he not come from the temple yet? Does he intend to stay for the <em>naalu kaala poojai</em>?&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Dharma. May be he has gone to your village.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;To Tiruvaiyaru? Then it will be midnight when he returns&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;He may even return tomorrow&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t he say a word to you, before he goes?&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;So what if he does not?&rdquo; It was convenient to deflect her slight anger on Dharma.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;It does not matter to me, my dear. I asked you only because you have still not eaten. We have all digested our lunch. But you have still kept the <em>kuzhambu</em> on the side stove in the fireplace, keeping it warm for him. Look at the <em>pooja</em> alcove! The strung flowers, the <em>dhoopa </em>holder and the lamp are waiting for him too. And you are passing your time stroking and arranging the betel leaves...&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;No one here is worried about how I pass my time. And why did<em> you</em> come?&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yes! I came here to swipe off your yearly stock of tamarind!&rdquo; Dharmambal retorted in sarcasm, flicking her shoulder with her chin.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">For a while they sat there without looking at each other.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I will eat in the evening when it is time to milk the cows, if he is not home even then,&rdquo; Lalitha said appeasingly.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You are going to eat now.&rdquo; Dharma pulled Lalitha and made her sit down. Then she spread the leaf and served the food.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I know. If there is a gathering of <em>satsangam</em> in Tiruvaiyaru he will forget everything, even his wife, why even what he is wearing! There must be a limit to your love and patience&hellip; mmm&hellip; start eating.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">After Lalitha had eaten some food she continued, &ldquo;Shyama Krishnan may be your husband, but I got married and moved here six years before you... I have seen him grow up. I knew even then&hellip; that the woman who becomes his wife will go through this torment.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Dharma, do you think I am suffering? Not at all. I have an abundance of everything at home by Kamakshi&rsquo;s grace. When I step down on the street, everyone shows their respect. Our two sons are doing well too.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;True, true. But if that were so, why does he cry out in song after song, &lsquo;Protect me, have you no compassion, will you show no mercy?&rsquo; It is almost as if he will uproot Bangaru Kamakshi with his desperate pleas.&rdquo;</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lalitha was slightly stunned.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Madness of devotion! Anything in excess is a danger. You must be careful.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lalitha stopped eating.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand Dharma&hellip; he is not like us &mdash; satisfied with a life where one just eats, sleeps , milks the cows and bears children. His heart yearns for a fulfilment beyond that&hellip; I truly understand that, Dharma.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yes&hellip; sure, it is just me&hellip; incapable of comprehension!&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You will understand too, if you would only stop talking unceasingly and think for a moment.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Silly girl! You know his father repeatedly told him to give up this music and focus on service at the temple. But this boy was too stubborn. He absorbed the art of Music from Sangitha Swamigal, a visitor who stayed at home, and now just breathes and lives music, leaving you alone.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I am fine, Dharma. You are saying all this only because you are very fond of me.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She went out to the backyard to wash her hands, when a question was aimed at her from behind.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Tell me the truth, Lalitha&hellip;Do you not suffer a loneliness that we do not? With all the comforts at your command does not an invisible gap separate him from you? It is not just that... They say that Shyama Krishnan suddenly gets up in the middle of the night and starts talking to Amba Kamakshi&hellip; are you not afraid? When he chooses he shows you his love, at other times he behaves like one possessed&hellip; how do you bear with it?&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rubbing her fingers clean, Lalitha was reminded of the solitary crow which tried to break the quietness.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dharma&rsquo;s questions were also aimed at breaking the vast quietude in the deep recesses of her heart&hellip; questions which could steal their way through the little disturbances stored in her heart&rsquo;s corner... fierce questions which were intent on uprooting the foundation of her heart&rsquo;s depths.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wiping her hands on her <em>saree</em> ends, she came again to sit near Dharma.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Finished..? Have you finished your interrogation?&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Dharma, I was indeed filled with the fear, the loneliness, and the exclusion that you speak of. But now they are almost gone. It is not because I have resigned myself to his nature&hellip; it is because I have fully and completely understood him. The fear and the feeling of exclusion have truly disappeared, but the loneliness&hellip; the loneliness&hellip;&rdquo; Lalitha continued clearing the huskiness in her voice. &ldquo;I confess that I am unable to conquer the feeling of loneliness.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I feel sorry for you, Lalitha. That man will never fully comprehend your loneliness.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;But I am not sorry. I am happy that I am here for him when he returns. And I bear the loneliness.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Martyrdom?&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Do not use such big words. Have you heard his <em>Yadhukula kambhoji swarajathi</em>?&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Who has not? It is Shyama Krishnan&rsquo;s <em>swarajathi</em>s which are heard everywhere.

Could anyone else have given a tangible form, a musical form to Her Eternal Youth and her Spiritual Being, Dharma? Isn&rsquo;t it to this Shyama Krishnan, whom you constantly criticise, that She has given Herself? I think it is my good fortune to wait for such a man and to endure loneliness in that waiting. This good fortune transcends the man-woman divide, the husband-wife bond&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She hid her flooding eyes in the folds of her <em>saree</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;This <em>swarajathi</em> and his <em>keerthanai</em>s will spread waves of joy for so many years reaching so many persons.

In Kovida Yalamanchi&rsquo;s case, a teenager! A 12th grade student, Kovida has recently launched her debut book <em>The Window Seat and Other Stories</em> which includes 11 stories with different themes. &ldquo;Ever since I was young, people told me that I should write because I have a very interesting sense of humour,&rdquo; she smiles. With a passion for writing, Kovida wrote a few stories a few years back and her mother sent it to one of her friends without telling her who wrote it. The appreciation for the writing was immense and her mother encouraged her to write.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The stories are inspired by the experiences she has been through. &ldquo;I have made them fictional; I converted my observations to stories with a moral; something you can take away from each one of them,&rdquo; she points out.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The book has everything for teenagers and also the problems they face. &ldquo;One of the problems I think is we are always running late and there is a story about that. There is also one on being greedy and a teenage girl and the problems that she is going through.&rdquo; The feedback has been positive. &ldquo;Our close friends have said that when they read the story, they felt that the way I speak in the stories is usually how my mom usually speaks. They say I have picked up a lot of things from her.&rdquo;</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kovida calls herself a regular teenager who likes to watch movies and Youtube videos. &ldquo;I recently got a phone and was never into social media . I don&rsquo;t have a Facebook account; In that sense that it helps because I didn&rsquo;t have any distractions,&rdquo; she smiles. She holds mentor programmes for teenage girls of Aashrita and the proceeds of book will go to the NGO in Secunderabad. &ldquo;The programmes are about giving confidence to the Aashrita girls,&rdquo; she states.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A trained pianist, she had also started the organisation Reading with the Tunes. &ldquo;It is about reading and music. These are two disciplines that I have grown up with,&rdquo; she says.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before concluding Kovida wonders if her book has reached its target audience. &ldquo;The challenge was to know, &lsquo;Will people like it or not.&rsquo; This is my first book and I want to know if everybody enjoys it. Also when someone tells me, &lsquo;I have a favourite story&rsquo; I am like, &lsquo;Oh you didn&rsquo;t like the rest.&rsquo; The challenge is to make it fit to a particular audience. I wrote the book for teenagers but then a lot of adults are reading it. I want to know whether youngsters of my age like it or not. The struggle is knowing that.&rdquo;</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/tales1475822798060.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babcefb210157e920b07f9","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"kovida yalamanchi"},{"text":"the window seat and other stories"},{"text":"stories"},{"text":"writer"},{"text":"book"},{"text":"reading"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/tales-from-a-teenagers-life/article9192854.ece","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-07T06:46:59.309Z","udate":"2016-10-07T09:43:59.681Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-07T06:45:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f744e34a8d835943bd2de6","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out7231.mp3","tagsForSearch":"kovida yalamanchi,the window seat and other stories,stories,writer,book,reading","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Naturally, the First Indian War of Independence (1857-1859) inspired historians, writers, poets, folk singers to re-create an inspiring and living picture of the great saga.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the recent past we have seen a few theatrical productions on this theme which were a kind of documentary projecting prominent dramatis personae of this rebellion with sketchily drawn characters. Recently, we have the opportunity to watch &ldquo;1857 &ndash; Turrebaz Khan&rdquo; presented by Qadir Ali Baig Theatre Foundation, Hyderabad at India Habitat Centre, which deserves to be considered as a milestone in contemporary Indian theatre. The sacrifice of a common Indian, his commitment, his passion, his unshakable faith in his struggle and his courage to die for the honour of his country is shown with dramatic force.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The production also highlights a very vital issue, the issue to project our unsung heroes which still survive in folk songs but historians and creative persons have done little to perpetuate the memory of these heroes. The production exposes the Indian running dogs of British and their collaborators. The theatrical artistry is marked by intricacy, economy and realism resonating with an undercurrent that reveal antagonistic forces at work.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Writer, director and actor Mohammad Ali is a talented creative person who is enriching the legacy of his father Qadir Ali Baig (1938-1984), the doyen of contemporary Indian theatre, who has produced artistic and socially relevant plays. Qadir Ali Baig Theatre Foundation was set up in Hyderabad in 2005 as a tribute to him which is being chaired by his wife Begum Razia Beg and led by his son Mohammad Ali Baig.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">An advertising and documentary filmmaker, Mohammad&rsquo;s plays have featured abroad evoking rave reviews. &ldquo;1857: Turrebaz Khan&rdquo; was premiered at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and in London in August. Its Indian premiere in Delhi was an artistically satisfying experience.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Set in a jungle, the play unfolds with the confrontation between two characters &mdash; Turrebaz Khan, a revolutionary fighter in the First Indian War of Independence from a humble family background and Qurban Ali, the captor of the revolutionary soldier. Qurban Ali comes from a privileged class and is a lackey of Nizam and British. These two characters have diabolically conflicting motives. Dialogues are economically written, chiselled expressively enough to convey the political, social and economic landscape of the time in which the action is set. The prisoner is tied with a rope to a chair, his interrogator sits on another chair at some distance. The interrogator gradually becomes defensive and his prisoner more and more aggressive, logical and irrefutable in his arguments. Gradually, the captor becomes apologetic, asking him to submit mercy appeal. In an irreverent tone, the prisoner retorts why this mercy? &ldquo;Once I was in the Haveli of my uncle, I humiliated you for attempting to pluck mangoes from the orchard. This continues to prick my conscience.&rdquo; He frees his prisoner. With the alacrity of a guerilla, the prisoner ties his captor with the same rope and escapes in the darkness of the night. We hear deafening gun shots off stage.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">To this remarkably realistic piece is incorporated fantasy world of a woman who plays two drums. The sounds of the beats are shrill. Bemoaning, she says, &ldquo;Why does my drum sound different because I am a woman? The fair&hellip;rather the weaker gender! Phew! Born to suffer or rather, made to bear, to be patient to be born, then to beats different.&hellip;&rdquo; In contrast, follows the beats of drum played by an image of man. These images are set upstage behind a transparent screen. It imparts the production a metaphorical meaning that all oppressed people need a powerful resolve to inflict defeat on the oppressor.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the highlights of the production is evoking of the social ambience of a forest with camp office to act as a torture cell. The imaginative lighting, the off-stage sounds of forest birds, the music composed by Pandit Mallikarjun Mansur and Mohammad Ali Baig form the part of the artistic whole of the production. The two lanterns casting their dim lights impart an aura of magic and reflect period colour. Mohammad Ali Baig as prisoner and Vijay Prasad as Qurban Ali, the captor, give riveting performances. Noor Baig beating drums behind the screen echoes the agonised world of an enslaved humanity desperate for liberation.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/07DFR_BAJELI2_1_3035945f1475823984365.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf66aebfe246bd8ebdfe5","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"diwan singh bajeli"},{"text":"mohammad ali baig 1857 – turrebaz khan"},{"text":"first war of independence"},{"text":"qadir ali baig theatre foundation"},{"text":"india habitat centre"},{"text":"indian theatre"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/resolve-of-the-oppressed/article9193563.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-07T07:06:45.511Z","udate":"2016-10-07T09:41:38.773Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-07T07:06:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f74985f6280d58e8c2b6fe","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out3660.mp3","tagsForSearch":"diwan singh bajeli,mohammad ali baig 1857 – turrebaz khan,first war of independence,qadir ali baig theatre foundation,india habitat centre,indian theatre","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57f74a49f807295d859fdbca","title":"Beneath the covers","subtitle":"The play Urmila, based on the epic character, is against interpretation","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mangala N. of Sanchari Theatre performed the solo play <em>Urmila </em>&ndash; which she has also directed &ndash; earlier this week, at Kappanna Angala, a small but inspiring space for the arts. This was the play&rsquo;s 25th show since its beginning in 2004. Mangala, a close disciple of B. V. Karanth, worked on this play just before she started her theatre group which has been continuously growing in size and scope.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The dominant narrative of the Ramayana is a story of glory: of the <em>dharma</em> of vows, filial piety, brotherly love, &lsquo;civilizing&rsquo; missions, conquests, morality, fidelity and honour &ndash; and an unequivocal notion of good over evil. But when read against the grain, the smaller and forgotten voices within it tell stories that are more real &ndash; humane and colourful &ndash; cracking open the dominant narrative.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Urmila, the wife of Lakshmana, is one such character that has been resurrected by Kuvempu in his Sri Ramayana Darshanam. And H. S. Venkatesha Murthy&rsquo;s play, Urmila, gives her the centrestage as a strong woman whose sense of optimism, in spite of grief, is palpable.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The stage is open, with minimal props: a carved pillar behind which character-transformation happens, and a stool to sit on. The artist wears a neutral costume of a white, nine-yard sari thus ensuring the emphasis on the literature of the play. Gajana Naik&rsquo;s music intersperses the act with songs that give Urmila&rsquo;s words a soulful aesthetic, and Vinay Chandra&rsquo;s lighting helps colour the spectrum of emotions.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The short 50-minute play portrays Urmila in a bitter-sweet haze, about to welcome back her husband after 14 years of separation. A look back shows Dasharatha mournfully accepting to send Rama on a fourteen year exile in order to keep his word with <em>Kaikeyi</em>. Seeta goes along with her husband while Lakshmana decides to accompany them. He disallows Urmila from going with him by binding her in entreaties of <em>dharma</em>. Although unconvinced by his shaky arguments, she decides to honour him by staying back as the true<em>gruhini</em>: an efficient housekeeper, a gracious host, and a loving mother. Her need for the love and companionship of a husband is considered unimportant in this scheme ruled by <em>dharma</em>. In the Ramayana, Lakshmana goes away to participate in many adventures, while Urmila inhabits a dark space away from the author&rsquo;s mind. In the play however, the protagonist Urmila lives her life to the fullest &ndash; while battling loneliness and sorrow. In her words, the burning of Lanka is a vengeful assault on a peaceable population rather than the prevalence of good over evil; its conquest is a matter of cultural domination; and Hanumantha&rsquo;s subservience is a matter of psychological enslavement.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">When Lakshamana returns basking in his triumph, he notices the city flooded with flowers but fails to understand that they come from the trees that Urmila has planted and nurtured in his absence.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The last scene where Mangala unfolds strips of green cloth lined up on the stage and holds them up in a towering canopy, is stunning for its symbolic value. While her husband went away into the forest, she made the forest come to her and loved it like her own child, thus subverting the narrative while living within the confines of her limited role.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mangala says that she saw the image of Salumarada Thimakka in this characterisation of Urmila and felt an instant need to embody this thought. In the play, Urmila is constantly weaving flowers into a garland &ndash; an activity of creation, of construction, which Mangala sees as a hopeful push against desperation and loss. She performed these emotions with such conviction that it was apparent that the tears in the audience&rsquo;s eyes were effortless.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/07bgf20161003_1916_3035817e1475824180675.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf66aebfe246bd8ebdfe5","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"mangala n"},{"text":"sanchari theatre"},{"text":"urmila"},{"text":"mangala n. of sanchari theatre"},{"text":"kappanna angala"},{"text":"arts"},{"text":"theatre"},{"text":"b. v. karanth"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/beneath-the-covers/article9193364.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-07T07:10:01.095Z","udate":"2016-10-07T09:40:33.827Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-07T07:09:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f74a49f807295d859fdbcc","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6313.mp3","tagsForSearch":"mangala n,sanchari theatre,urmila,mangala n. of sanchari theatre,kappanna angala,arts,theatre,b. v. karanth","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

A few days later, when she noticed it was still present, she wondered if she should get it checked. At just 33, she thought she was too young to get diagnosed with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Breast-Cancer\">breast cancer</a> and almost ignored it. However, after a talk with her mother, she decided to go for tests and was shocked when she was told that it was an early stage of cancer. Had she ignored the lump, her survival rates would not be the same as when they were at diagnosis. With timely treatment and a change in her lifestyle, Mahek is cancer free. Her case is far from isolated. In fact a number of health experts are noticing a steady rise in the number of cases of breast cancer among younger women. And October, which is celebrated as the Breast Cancer Awareness Month around the globe, is hoping to raise awareness about this disease that claims millions of lives each year.<br /><br /><strong>Know symptoms and risk factors</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Says breast oncosurgeon <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Dr-Bhavisha-Ghugare\">Dr Bhavisha Ghugare</a>, \"Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Current estimates say that this year alone, at least 246,660 new cases will be diagnosed. The chance that a woman will die from breast cancer is about one in 36. Many women simply ignore the signs or are unaware about symptoms to watch out for. Some of the most common risk factors are family history and genetics, older age, early menstruation, late menopause, nulliparity or having the first child at an older age, excessive alcohol intake, radiation exposure to the chest wall and obesity (having more fat tissue especially after menopause can increase the chance of getting breast cancer by raising estrogen levels.\"<br />Adds <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/surgical-oncologist\">surgical oncologist</a> Dr Ramakant Deshpande, \"Women should always watch out for symptoms like a lump in the breast or underarm, unusual discharge from the nipple, lumps or pain the breast, unusual skin tone of either of the breast or a reddish appearance or change in size of the breasts. Breast cancer is caused due to damage to a cell's DNA. If someone from your family had breast cancer, you have higher chances of having it. In older women, the usage of Hormone Replacement Therapy to treat menopausal symptoms may also cause breast cancer. \"<br /><br /><strong>Diagnosing and treating breast cancer</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"A breast examination, mammogram, breast ultrasound and biopsy (removing a sample of breast cells for testing) can help diagnose breast cancer. There are different kinds of biopsies &mdash; fine needle aspiration, core biopsy or open biopsy &mdash; which your doctor will advise depending on the findings. MRIs can also help diagnose it. Most women with breast cancer will have some types of surgery to remove the tumour. Depending on the type of breast cancer and how advanced it is, you may need other types of treatment as well, either before or after surgery or sometimes both. Surgery is less likely to be a main part of the treatment for more advanced breast cancer. There are several ways to treat breast cancer depending on its type and stage. Local treatment is when the tumour is treated without affecting the rest of the body. This includes surgery and radiation. Systemic treatment is called as such because doctors can reach cancer cells anywhere in the body. This includes chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and targeted therapy,\" explains Dr Ghugare.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Increasing occurrence among young women</strong></p>\n<div class=\"last7brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The increasing incidence of breast cancer among younger women is a big problem globally. \"No one knows for sure why younger women are getting breast cancer. It could be attributed to hormonal factors such as having children late in life, taking birth control pills or an inherited gene mutation,\" says Dr Ghugare.</div>\n<div class=\"last6brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /><strong>The importance of self breast examination</strong></div>\n<div class=\"last4brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />Self examination of the breast is extremely important, say experts. \"If breast cancer is treated at an early stage, it is easier to treat it successfully. Check your breasts after you finish your monthly menstrual cycle or make it a habit to check your breast at least once a month without fail. Don't panic if you see or feel any lumps because it is not necessarily cancerous every time. You can use mirror while examining your breast. Don't forget to check the nipples because there could be changes in them as well. Don't wait for a later age for self examination. Once you cross 20, make it a habit to start examining your breasts,\" advises Deshpande.</div>\n<div class=\"last3brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be aware about screening techniques. It is mandatory to go for breast exams after 40. Go for a breast exam in your 30s if your doctor feels there is a need for a check-up</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/images_(1)1475826229103.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf22bea63af2cd0d81cda","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"dr bhavisha ghugare"},{"text":"breast cancer"},{"text":"oncologist"},{"text":"dr ramakant deshpande"},{"text":"hormone"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/Breast-cancer-on-the-rise-among-younger-women/articleshow/54714280.cms","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-07T07:44:09.380Z","udate":"2016-10-07T09:20:47.884Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-07T07:43:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f75249339bda5d32978d37","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out4616.mp3","tagsForSearch":"dr bhavisha ghugare,breast cancer,oncologist,dr ramakant deshpande,hormone","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

In a cross-sectional study involving more than 479 parents and children, dentists screened children for basic oral health and asked parents to fill up a questionnaire. Analysis showed that more than one in 10 parents knew that their child does not brush adequately . Yet, more than half the parents haven't taken their children for annual dental checks.</p>\n<div class=\"last7brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">While 34% of parents admitted they have delayed or put off scheduling appointments with dentists, nearly 30% said their children caused the delay . \"Many parents think buying dental kits such as toothbrush and toothpaste is the end of parental dental care. The number of times children should brush, the amount of time they should spend or the right technique is hardly taught. Many parents don't even make regular visits to dentists,\" said the study's corresponding author Dr Deepa Gurunathan, associate professor, depart ment of paediatric dentistry, Saveetha Dental College.</div>\n<div class=\"last7brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"last4brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">What was more worrying for doctors was that at least 60% of parents admit that their children snack between snack between meals. \"It is one of the leading causes of dental problems in children. Some parents tell us they are not able to stop their children from doing this. At some point, we feel there is a sense of neglect,\" said Dr Gurunathan. \"We see two-and-a-half-year-old children requiring complete mouth rehabilitation as all 20 teeth have decayed,\" she said.</div>\n<div class=\"last4brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"last2brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dentists say that three in five children in the city have oral hygiene problems such as plaque, tartar or cavities, but the study showed that the risk of dental neglect is high when parents' awareness or income levels were inadequate, said Dr Arunachalam Karthikeyan Shanmugaavel, who co-authored the study . Lack of adequate oral hygiene has worried paediatricians, who say the mouth is the gateway to health. A range of health problems from psychological problems, heart disease and retardation have been linked to poor oral health. A study published by the same group of dentists earlier this year showed an association between obesity and dental caries. The prevalence of dental caries was found to be more in obese and overweight children than normal and underweight children. \"It is established that pregnant women with poor oral hygiene can give birth to low birth weight babies. We are now doing a study to see if educating pregnant women can improve oral hygiene in children,\" she said.</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/parents1475827875950.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf22bea63af2cd0d81cda","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"dental care"},{"text":"teeth"},{"text":"kids"},{"text":"oral hygiene"},{"text":"obesity"},{"text":"dental caries"},{"text":"dr arunachalam karthikeyan shanmugaavel"},{"text":"psychological problems"},{"text":"saveetha dental college"},{"text":"dr deepa gurunathan"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/Parents-dental-care-lacks-teeth-3-in-5-kids-have-poor-oral-hygiene/articleshow/54710248.cms","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-07T08:11:36.132Z","udate":"2016-10-07T09:21:22.182Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-07T08:10:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f758b8b38e1d5d6a0c2f5e","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6424.mp3","tagsForSearch":"dental care,teeth,kids,oral hygiene,obesity,dental caries,dr arunachalam karthikeyan shanmugaavel,psychological problems,saveetha dental college,dr deepa gurunathan","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Give your skin more fluids and eat right for healthy skin, says an expert.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">October being the beginning of the festive season, is generally the time when most people plan their vacation. The days tend to be very hot and humid in October. So, Chandrika Mahendra, Principal Scientist, Personal Care, The Himalaya Drug Company, suggests how to keep skin glowing all day long.</p>\n<div class=\"last7brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">- One of the basic mantras for beating the October heat is to get more fluids into your body. Your skin glows and appears healthier when your body is adequately hydrated. If you are heading to one of the beaches in southern India, treat yourself generously with tender coconut water. It is not only low in calories but has anti-oxidants, Vitamin C and other essential minerals that enrich your skin.</div>\n<div class=\"last5brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />- Excessive oily food may cause acne, and the heat only makes it worse. Look for fruits that are rich in Vitamin C such as orange, lemon and kiwi. They help to maintain moisture balance in your skin and Vitamin C also helps build protection against skin wrinkling.</div>\n<div class=\"last3brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"last3brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">- Peel-off that tan: After a day-out in the sun, try out a natural anti-tan peel off mask. An orange-based peel off mask is a good pick. Oranges are rich in Vitamin C and the antioxidants present in the orange peel will work collectively to provide an even-textured skin and act as a natural cleanser. Ingredients such as honey can also act as an anti-bacterial element with healing properties.</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/download_(1)1475831837665.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf9baa2f5892d06478e23","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"fluids"},{"text":"healthy skin"},{"text":"chandrika mahendra"},{"text":"the himalaya drug company"},{"text":"festive season"},{"text":"hydrated"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/beauty/Keep-your-skin-glowing-with-these-easy-tips/articleshow/54732759.cms","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-07T09:17:37.607Z","udate":"2016-10-07T09:22:02.435Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-07T09:16:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f76831339bda5d32978d9c","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out1345.mp3","tagsForSearch":"fluids,healthy skin,chandrika mahendra,the himalaya drug company,festive season,hydrated","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

For many, it&rsquo;s a defining period of their lives, a window to something wonderful.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But while we continue reading and discovering prose through our adult lives &mdash; short stories, novels, non-fiction, news articles &mdash; poetry tends to be the genre we lose touch with.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The new-age poets</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But social media &mdash; blamed often for making us read less &mdash; is determined to surprise, yet again. On Instagram, jostling for &lsquo;followers&rsquo; alongside #foodporn photos, filtered vacation landscapes, and the deluge of selfies is good old poetry.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mumbai-based student Harnidh Kaur (21) has 10.6k Instagram followers, and launched a book earlier this year. A YouTube video of Shamir Reuben (23; content head at a performance art platform) performing a spoken word piece called Everything&rsquo;s Fine clocked 41,000 views in 10 days. Then, 21-year-old poet Kusha Verma, the chief amazement officer (founder, in other words) of Art Refurbish, an online publishing platform, has 7,673 followers on Instagram.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These poets post their work primarily on Instagram. On a purely visual medium, the poetry has been adapted and turned into a visual experience: typewriter fonts, backgrounds of yellowed paper or plain white, and the occasional accompanying sketch.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And it works for a generation collectively suffering from attention deficit. The poems are short, and written simply, something you&rsquo;d figure out instantly. Consider Reuben&rsquo;s work. His Instagram feed is a series of life lessons: &ldquo;Adversity throws bricks at you. Experience teaches you how to build walls,&rdquo; reads one of his posts. The Mumbai-based poet says, &ldquo;I started writing poetry at 17. [But] It wasn&rsquo;t until turning 20 that I felt like I was writing good poetry. The good thing about social media is the interaction is two-way; so there&rsquo;s feedback and the encouragement acts as an incentive to keep writing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><iframe id=\"instagram-embed-0\" class=\"instagram-media instagram-media-rendered\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BLI0CG5g7aw/embed/?v=7\" width=\"300\" height=\"687\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-instgrm-payload-id=\"instagram-media-payload-0\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Social media has also made poetry accessible to an audience that&rsquo;s constantly online. &ldquo;People may not buy a book of poetry or subscribe to a magazine for it,&rdquo; points out Nilesh Mondal (23), a poet and engineering student from Asansol, West Bengal. Mondal, who posts as @hungover.hamlet, is also a writer with TTT (Terribly Tiny Tales), a micro-fiction collective. He adds that in smaller cities, where not many poetry-related events take place, the internet is a saviour.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How it all began</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The rise of the Instagram poet, like so many other trends, first occurred in the West. New Zealand-based Lang Leav, who writes on love and heartbreak, struck gold in 2012 when her work began to be noticed. Leav (275k Instagram followers) launched her first poetry collection, Love &amp; Misadventure, in 2013, and is slated to launch her fourth collection, The Universe of Us, this month. According to The New York Times, Leav&rsquo;s three collections have collectively sold more than 300,000 copies so far.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><iframe id=\"instagram-embed-1\" class=\"instagram-media instagram-media-rendered\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BK9f-_QDaxd/embed/?v=7\" width=\"300\" height=\"834\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-instgrm-payload-id=\"instagram-media-payload-1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Leav is not alone. Her partner, Michael Faudet (97.5k followers) also has two best-sellers to his name. He writes on love and erotica. Other Instapoets such as Tyler Knott Gregson (303k followers) and RM Drake (1.6m followers), too, have gone on to sign book deals.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We followed the trend, even borrowed the typed-out layouts. &ldquo;Micro-fiction&rsquo;s beauty lies in being minimalist and poignant; therefore, the large blank spaces with little text,&rdquo; says Reuben. He creates his posts using an app, The Amazing Typewriter. Actor and Instapoet Arunoday Singh (33) is an exception here. He physically writes his &lsquo;Sufiana&rsquo; poetry in a calligraphic font, &ldquo;I write my poems in a journal, or any other piece of paper. I then take photos with my phone and play around with filters.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><iframe id=\"instagram-embed-2\" class=\"instagram-media instagram-media-rendered\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BLLqTNhhLyY/embed/?v=7\" width=\"300\" height=\"687\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-instgrm-payload-id=\"instagram-media-payload-2\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But appearances notwithstanding, the Indian Instapoets seem to be consciously trying to be different.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most popular international ones are known for their sentimental pieces. &lsquo;When you leave, it storms. The sky screams and weeps. You come home and it is painted once more,&rsquo; writes Gregson.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But with Indian poets, the themes are different, often serious. Kaur&rsquo;s writing is feminist. Mondal&rsquo;s ranges from an erotica spin to Harry Potter&rsquo;s characters (&lsquo;Imagine Luna Lovegood with her collection of sex toys &mdash; ropes and vibrators and lubricants&rsquo;) to a poem inspired by Omran Daqneesh, the Syrian child whose photo of being dazed in an ambulance became a symbol of the fallout of war (&lsquo;The kid who survived a war, died with his heart in hand&hellip;&rsquo;).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><iframe id=\"instagram-embed-3\" class=\"instagram-media instagram-media-rendered\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BJTHwJ0hTSp/embed/?v=7\" width=\"300\" height=\"751\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-instgrm-payload-id=\"instagram-media-payload-3\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kaur, who recently posted about war in light of the Uri attack, says she is not a fan of Lang Leav. &ldquo;A lot of international poets pander heavily to a market that wants easily digestible poetry. Indian poets are going beyond generic love poems, and writing about conflict, politics, identity,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Writing about sensitive or controversial issues also brings with it extreme reactions. Kaur, who has often written on war, Kashmir and Manipur, says, &ldquo;There are always people with strong beliefs attacking your beliefs. That&rsquo;s part and parcel of putting up your work on social media.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><iframe id=\"instagram-embed-4\" class=\"instagram-media instagram-media-rendered\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BJuSchdAOnl/embed/captioned/?v=7\" width=\"300\" height=\"763\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-instgrm-payload-id=\"instagram-media-payload-4\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Going pro</strong></p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like international ones, home-grown Instapoets too have leveraged social media success into something bigger. Harnidh Kaur launched a collection of 66 poems, The Inability of Words (Writer&rsquo;s Workshop India), this July. She says it&rsquo;s sold over 500 copies, and she now has a book deal with Thought Catalog for next year. Mondal too, has a collection due next February.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The big question then is: is online poetry just a hobby or a viable career option? Kaur doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s sustainable to be a poet. She&rsquo;s studying for a Master&rsquo;s in public policy, and plans to work in policy or governmental administration. &ldquo;The market [for poetry in India] is growing, we&rsquo;re making poetry sexy again, but being a poet is not sustainable,&rdquo; she says.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><iframe id=\"instagram-embed-5\" class=\"instagram-media instagram-media-rendered\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/-HbtklMae1/embed/captioned/?v=7\" width=\"300\" height=\"712\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-instgrm-payload-id=\"instagram-media-payload-5\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the other hand, Mondal remains optimistic: &ldquo;It seems ambitious right now, but in five years, I hope there&rsquo;s a big enough market.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t help that publishing houses don&rsquo;t take a chance on emerging poets. &ldquo;The big, traditional houses work only with big names,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fortunately, social media doesn&rsquo;t have gatekeepers. Instapoets write for a generation that can&rsquo;t be bothered with the stamp of literary cred. As long as your poetry is simple, and compels one to feel or think, people will double tap on your post.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5 International Instapoets to follow</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Tyler Knott Gregson (303k followers)</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This American poet and photographer&rsquo;s Instagram feed is positively dreamy.

{"_id":"57f77dd1f2efff597a396084","title":"‘I gave my books away, and it was not easy,’ writes Sidharth Bhatia","subtitle":"The agony of parting with your favourite books isn’t easy to overcome.","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb900dea63af2cd0d814cf","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A few weeks ago, I gave away some books; a lot of books, about 250 of them. It was not easy - libraries, small and big, did not want them, the raddi walla offered a measly Rs 5 per kilo and friends sympathised but politely demurred. Eventually I offered them to an NGO which gratefully took them; their annual sale of books helps them raise funds for their work.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giving away books was not something I ever thought I would do. For me, and to many of my generation, a sizable personal collection, if not a grand library, was a worthy ambition to have. Like many others, I prided myself on entering a bookshop and then exiting with my hands full of books and a wallet considerably lightened. Full bookshelves showed knowledge and erudition I thought and I was also convinced that they emitted positive vibes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But in my typical Mumbai apartment, shelf space was a luxury and I had almost stopped buying any more books. Then one day, when my father passed away some time ago, all the books he had bought over six decades came to me. Instead of unqualified delight, I viewed this gift with mixed feelings.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The decision of which books to keep and which to part with is never an easy one. Over the years, a book collection acquires a personality; there is a story attached to each book. For me, the dilemma was now twice as big. The new books I had acquired had my father&rsquo;s memory attached to them. Why did he buy those books and what did they mean to him?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Going through his books, I began to &lsquo;read&rsquo; him, trying to unravel his interests and slowly, discovering a small window to his times. What were people from his generation reading?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A lot of books on English literature, which was understandable since other global writing didn&rsquo;t make it to India those days; a fairly impressing collection of poetry; several books by and about Nehru &ndash; clearly demonstrating those heady days when the first prime minister was the country&rsquo;s great hero; vast numbers of books published in the Soviet Union and sold in India (at very cheap prices) through the People&rsquo;s Publishing House outlets in Bombay. There were surprisingly few bestsellers&mdash;so was my father averse to popular writing and only believed in high-culture? It was almost as if I had caught a glimpse into a part of him that was hidden from everyone else.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most of these books would not be available today and even at a casual glance, they looked old fashioned &ndash; the binding, the cover design, the font &ndash; things that often excite bibliophiles. That by itself should have been sufficient motivation to keep them lovingly in a glass-encased bookshelf.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But even as I opened the cartons and looked at each book with joy and wonder, I knew I had a problem on my hands. I would have to find space to accommodate them. Books have found themselves a perch not just in bookshelves but also on every available table, chair, on top of cupboards and on the floor. I can swear &ndash; on a stack of books &ndash; that I have not bought any book recently, but still the mountain grows.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unmanageable numbers of books can also lead to domestic strife, especially if one party has an unreasonable aversion to parting with books that he has no intention of reading again. Regular culling is always a good idea, but I am a hoarder and have not even switched on the Kindle so kindly given to me as a gift. I was feeling the brunt of changing times. I used to be stingy about loaning my books; now I could not give them away.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I felt a pang when the books finally were gone. But I was fretful &ndash; would the new owners treat them like they deserved to be treated?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The &ldquo;problem&rdquo; still hasn&rsquo;t been fully solved. If the criteria of &ldquo;are these books of any relevance to us&rdquo; is applied, even more may have to go. &ldquo;Books we have several editions of&rdquo; are likely to face the axe too. And of course there is a complete freeze on buying any more books, no matter how important, readable or beautiful-looking they are. For now, the shelves are looking glorious, the colourful spines of much-thumbed and well-loved books a sight to behold. I fear though it is a losing battle.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Sidharth Bhatia is a senior journalist and writer based in Mumbai and the Founding Editor of The Wire</em></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/books1475837372477.jpeg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57bab78473031e7ec856e982","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"books"},{"text":"bookshelf"},{"text":"culling"},{"text":"literature"},{"text":"mumbai"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.hindustantimes.com/brunch/i-gave-my-books-away-and-it-was-not-easy-writes-sidharth-bhatia/story-ChpccgH5iumWxKJm6AuYPN.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-07T10:49:53.608Z","udate":"2016-10-07T11:32:44.279Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-07T10:49:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f77dd1f2efff597a396086","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6385.mp3","tagsForSearch":"books,bookshelf,culling,literature,mumbai","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

So it&rsquo;s interesting to see how celebrities lose weight and still seem perfect. Here&rsquo;s what they know that you don&rsquo;t.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1. Additional vitamins and minerals</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Deficiency of vitamins B12, C, A, and biotin can lead to an accelerated ageing process. Celebs know it is important to consume good quality vitamins and minerals, so that while fat is metabolised, the body has reserves to keep the regeneration process on for the benefit of their skin and hair.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2. Facials and Body massages</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the process of weight loss, the skin becomes dry and ages rapidly. This makes facials, head massages with oil, and body massages essential. Go for body massages twice a week to boost circulation and ensure that the muscles and skin get proper nutrients.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>* For pitta skin:</strong> A mix of olive oil and almond oil</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>* For kapha skin:</strong> A mix of almond oil and sesame oil</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>* For vata skin: </strong>A mix of coconut oil and sesame oil</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3. Detoxification</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As body fat breaks down, toxins are released and deposited in the skin, joints, and deep body tissues. These must be removed via the digestive tract, meaning that a scientific detox is essential once every fortnight.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Detoxification involves the following process:</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>* The night before: </strong>Take triphala powder with a teaspoon of wheat bran and half a teaspoon of oat bran</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>* Early morning:</strong> A cup of hot water with a teaspoon of organic honey and a few drops of lemon</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>* Breakfast:</strong> Orange or masumbi, followed by a decoction of ginger with a pinch of trikatu powder and a teaspoon of honey</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>* Lunch:</strong> Fruit and vegetable soup</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>* Evening:</strong> Herbal tea or spice tea (a decoction of black pepper, cardamom, mint and cinnamon, but no tea leaves)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>* Dinner:</strong> Vegetable soup and herbs saut&eacute;ed in half a teaspoon of white butter.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/weight_loss1475837598637.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecfa9234a4ac2d218b2215","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"weight loss"},{"text":"vitamins"},{"text":"detoxification"},{"text":"herbal tea"},{"text":"celeb tips"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.hindustantimes.com/brunch/three-tips-for-weight-loss-that-celebs-follow/story-RcyKioaFsOPjCJE2V3WanN.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-07T10:53:39.196Z","udate":"2016-10-07T11:04:22.698Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-07T10:52:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f77eb3b547d25d4f55b57c","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out9138.mp3","tagsForSearch":"weight loss,vitamins,detoxification,herbal tea,celeb tips","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

But in that moment, no one understood the potential of the new scale for media and harnessed it for his own purposes as effectively as Prince did. He shook the culture, musically and racially, sexually and spiritually, transforming possibilities and ignoring rules. And if he never reached those heights again, and in many ways never recovered personally or creatively from the Purple Rain juggernaut, he still took us all to a place we had never been.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rocketown is an unassuming, warehouse-sized club just a few blocks from the Bridgestone Arena in downtown Nashville. Geared to Christian teenagers, it&rsquo;s adjacent to a skate park; there are pool tables upstairs, and the marquee lists a bunch of bands you&rsquo;ve never heard of. It is now May 2004, 20 years after the release of Purple Rain, and Prince has already finished a sold-out performance at the arena (which was still called the Gaylord Center at the time), followed by an additional ninety-minute set on Rocketown&rsquo;s stage, after which he has an almost three-week break in his touring schedule &mdash; &ldquo;I gotta go home and water the plants,&rdquo; he tells the crowd of five hundred or so with a laugh. Prince is in the midst of one of his periodic resurgences in popularity, spurred by both music and strategy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After a series of experimental and even surly records, released in the midst of his ongoing battles with the music industry, his new album, Musicology, is accessible and funky; not a breakthrough or a true classic, it&rsquo;s still a fully realised collection of satisfyingly Prince style songs. He made some high-profile media appearances (opening the Grammy Awards broadcast performing a medley with Beyonc&eacute;, singing for Ellen DeGeneres), delivered a knockout mini-set at his induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March, and concocted a plan in which everyone who bought a ticket for the tour received a copy of Musicology on his or her seat-each of which counts toward SoundScan&rsquo;s bestseller lists.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since the ninety-six-date run would prove to be the top grossing tour of the year, earning $87.4 million, this meant that the record would go gold and stay in the Top 10 for the whole summer, even if not one person bought a copy in stores. So Prince is happy. He has also recently become a Jehovah&rsquo;s Witness, and his conversation is now laced with frequent biblical references and allusions. The after-show performance at Rocketown offers the musical manifestation of this new Prince. Where these intimate, late-night gigs used to be cathartic, virtuoso displays, this time he leads his band through a set of loose funk jams. He bops through the crowd to listen from the soundboard and roams the stage cueing the players through a mash-up of Led Zeppelin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Whole Lotta Love&rdquo; and Santana&rsquo;s &ldquo;Soul Sacrifice.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s no tension, all release.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I&rsquo;m there to interview him for a cover story for Tracks, a magazine I founded and edited in the early 2000s, and after the show, I observe something even more unlikely: At 2:30 am, Prince can be found standing outside the stage door, hanging with his band members and talking to fans. The 30 or so clustered civilians are breathlessly excited to be in his presence, yet seem understanding when he tells them that he doesn&rsquo;t believe in signing autographs. He is, as always, shy and quiet, listening more than talking, but he actually seems to be enjoying the chance to mingle. One young woman tells him that Purple Rain was the first album she bought when she was in the first grade, but that her mother wouldn&rsquo;t let her see the movie because it was too risqu&eacute;. &ldquo;Just think about what &lsquo;too risqu&eacute;&rsquo; means today!&rdquo; Prince responds. Material from Purple Rain had provided the focus for the arena concert earlier in the evening. He performed seven of the album&rsquo;s nine tracks during the thirty-song, two-hour greatest hits set, closing with the title song. In the grimy Rocketown dressing room, though, he claims that the twentieth anniversary of the project is of little consequence to him. &ldquo;I was there,&rdquo; he tells me. &ldquo;I did it, it was my baby. I knew about it before it happened. I knew what it was going to be. Then it was just like labour, like giving birth-in &lsquo;84, it was so much work.&rdquo; In fact, he says, just a few nights earlier in Atlanta, The Time &mdash; the Minneapolis friends/rivals/contemporaries who played his nemeses in the film, and sometimes in real life- came out and performed during his show. &ldquo;We never got a chance to do the real Purple Rain tour, because The Time broke up,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But then, there they were, onstage last week, and people started tripping, and I was watching my favourite band. So there&rsquo;s no anniversary, no dates; we just have to have faith in Jehovah and lay back and ride it.&rdquo; (The fact that Prince became a Jehovah&rsquo;s Witness may also explain some of his attitude toward the anniversary of the album, since members of the religion do not celebrate birthdays.)

{"_id":"57f78d655c9c08595eb5596a","title":"‘The writer feels more isolated than ever before’","subtitle":"The first among the many to have returned their awards a year ago, Hindi writer Uday Prakash looks back at his decision that sparked a movement, and what’s changed since.","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb900dea63af2cd0d814cf","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Born in Shahdol in Madhya Pradesh, Hindi writer Uday Prakash is best known for his short stories Peeli Chhatri Waali Ladki and Mohandas, the latter a disturbing tale of a Dalit boy who sets off to rediscover his stolen identity. Later made into a film, Mohandas fetched Prakash the Sahitya Akademi Award for Hindi in 2010. Through his writings, Prakash has explored themes of displacement and alienation, and given voice to the concerns of the marginalised. Last year, Prakash was the first of many artistes to return his Akademi Award over the killing of fellow recipient, Kannada litterateur MM Kalburgi. He was objecting to the literary body&rsquo;s silence over the assaults on writers, and sparked a national debate over intolerance and nationalism.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>You returned your Sahitya Akademi Award a year ago in protest over the killing of M M Kalburgi. How do you look back on that decision?</strong><br />Honestly, it was fear that prompted my decision. All these killings were done by fanatics, by people of a particular mindset. Narendra Dabholkar, Govind Pansare and Kalburgi &mdash; they were all people like me, elderly. They were shot at home or while they were out on a walk. I had met Kalburgi twice. I knew Dabholkar too. These people were killed in cold blood and what surprised me was that there was no uproar over their deaths. The institution that had awarded Kalburgi did not even hold a condolence meeting for him. When a rail accident takes place, the department of railways goes to the home of the victim to console the family and offer compensation. But when these writers and rationalists were killed, no one reached out. It made me ponder, do we even exist for society? Do our awards have any meaning? Are these deaths like dry leaves falling somewhere soundlessly?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When I tried to express myself on social media, the reaction was such that I had never seen before. Previously, too, writers have been critical of many things but now, there was a mob trolling us in such abusive language that many of us took down our <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/facebook/\">Facebook</a> pages.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My decision to give up my award was shaped by fear, but fear also gave me courage. I recalled a Soviet film, The Ballad of a Soldier, in which a young soldier, who was part of the Russian army at war with the Nazis, commits a daring act because he fears losing a girl. When asked what prompted his brave act, he said, &lsquo;fear drove me&rsquo;. Similarly, unmindful of the consequences, I returned my award.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Did you anticipate the response that followed?</strong><br />The decision to return the award was an individual one. I hadn&rsquo;t anticipated the reaction that followed. Initially, I was scoffed at, but I got a lot of support from both English and regional authors including Nayantara Sahgal, Sarah Joseph and Ashok Vajpeyi. Not just writers, artistes from all fields came out in support of me and what started as an individual decision, gradually became a movement.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After I returned my award, I was away from the country for a month. When I got back, I discovered that from being known as a writer, I had gone on to become a person who had returned an award. That became my new identity. It had its problems but it also helped. For instance, when a meeting I addressed in Ahmedabad attracted a huge crowd, I knew we had made a difference.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>A writer works alone, but you got a lot of support after you returned your award. Did this act of solidarity enthuse you?</strong><br />I have been vice president of the Janwadi Lekhak Sangh (Progressives Writers&rsquo; Association), I became a full-time member of the Communist Party when I was 16. But after 1969, when even the Left writers&rsquo; groups became more of think-tanks who gave little freedom to individuals, it felt lonely to be a writer. With politics turning into a machine that runs on its own fuel of media, criminals and corporates, the writer feels more isolated than ever before, with only his readers left as supporters. So, loneliness is something that we have to deal with.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What are the challenges facing a writer in today&rsquo;s India?</strong><br />The only functional ideology in India remains the caste system. You will find that everyone in language and literature groups is organised along the lines of dominant castes. Even amongst writers, it is only the Savarnas that dominate, the non-Savarna writers are totally marginalised. But this domination is certainly being challenged. My writing too is challenging it but writers like us are challenging the existing order from the margins. We don&rsquo;t get the kind of support and privileges that some others do.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As Engles (German philosopher Friedrich Engles) said, language is the practical consciousness of humanity. Whatever you do, you think via language. So, it is in languages that you will find all thought distilled. Visit the department of Urdu, English or Hindi in any university and you will find conservatism, orthodoxy, sectarianism and all prevailing outlooks reflected there. It&rsquo;s difficult to modernise in such circumstances. Modernisation is India&rsquo;s prime challenge. We are still living in the medieval period, trapped in the thoughts expounded by Brahminism and Manu Smriti and living in hate. What else explains why so many Indians live in fear because of their eating habits? You are isolated unless you are &ldquo;one of them&rdquo;. Thinking writers are made to feel like they are a minority.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>We may be stuck in the past in many spheres, but India has also seen change.</strong><br />Yes, of course, there has been change. Go to the villages and you will see that the demography is changing and it&rsquo;s challenging the status quo, but those who are being confronted by this change too are fighting back, and fighting back aggressively. These are dangerous times, we are witnessing change and the pushback to it. New media and technology are fuelling rumours and media has become a powerful instigator of violence, spreading rumours, superstition and hate. This war-mongering media would make us believe we all want a war but go and speak to the people and you will see no one wants a war.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The jumlebazi and dialogues of Gabbar Singh and Sholay will go on, the hectoring will continue but this regime is losing the trust of people. The more that trust erodes, the more hysterical they become in their speech. This needs to be spooled back, calmly and coolly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>You studied and later taught at Delhi&rsquo;s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). What are your thoughts on the controversy that engulfed it earlier </strong><br /><strong>this year?</strong><br />The attack on JNU was an organised one. They want to finish certain institutions like JNU and FTII. This regime wants to destroy all institutions of excellence, knowledge and thinking. This is because they are not rational and don&rsquo;t have an ability to provide answers. When they introduce odd policies and are questioned on it, they have no answers. They want to finish off the tradition of thinking people.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What, according to you, is the role of artistes in shaping society? Should they speak out on issues?</strong><br />Painting, composing poems, making sculptures, all these are individual pursuits. Given the reality of the capitalist system, art usually survives on patronage but in times when masses galvanise and things pick up, artists do join movements. For instance, India&rsquo;s Independence movement saw the participation of artistes of all kinds.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/hindi1475841359915.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baaa06250c0156ce7311e9","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"sahitya akademi award"},{"text":"m m kalburgi"},{"text":"uday prakash"},{"text":"hindi writer"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/books/the-writers-feel-more-isolated-than-ever-before/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-07T11:56:21.471Z","udate":"2016-10-07T12:02:42.102Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-07T11:55:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f78d655c9c08595eb5596c","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out9515.mp3","tagsForSearch":"sahitya akademi award,m m kalburgi,uday prakash,hindi writer","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Give your skin more fluids and eat right for healthy skin, says an expert.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">October being the beginning of the festive season, is generally the time when most people plan their vacation. The days tend to be very hot and humid in October. So, Chandrika Mahendra, Principal Scientist, Personal Care, The Himalaya Drug Company, suggests how to keep skin glowing all day long.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">* One of the basic mantras for beating the October heat is to get more fluids into your body. Your skin glows and appears healthier when your body is adequately hydrated. If you are heading to one of the beaches in southern India, treat yourself generously with tender coconut water. It is not only low in calories but has anti-oxidants, Vitamin C and other essential minerals that enrich your skin.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>*</strong> Excessive oily food may cause acne, and the heat only makes it worse. Look for fruits that are rich in Vitamin C such as orange, lemon and kiwi. They help to maintain moisture balance in your skin and Vitamin C also helps build protection against skin wrinkling.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>*</strong>After a day-out in the sun, try out a natural anti-tan peel off mask. An orange-based peel off mask is a good pick. Oranges are rich in Vitamin C and the antioxidants present in the orange peel will work collectively to provide an even-textured skin and act as a natural cleanser. Ingredients such as honey can also act as an anti-bacterial element with healing properties.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/skin-main1475841893064.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baaa06250c0156ce7311e9","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"skin"},{"text":"sunrays"},{"text":"festive season"},{"text":"fluids"},{"text":"glowing skin"},{"text":"acne"},{"text":"moisture balance"},{"text":"anti-tan peel off mask"},{"text":"anti-bacterial element"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-style/this-festive-season-keep-skin-cool-and-glowing-with-these-easy-tips-3069150/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-07T12:05:13.374Z","udate":"2016-10-07T12:15:38.526Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-07T12:04:00.000Z","title_or_id":"","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f78f79f807295d859fde41","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out3362.mp3","tagsForSearch":"skin,sunrays,festive season,fluids,glowing skin,acne,moisture balance,anti-tan peel off mask,anti-bacterial element","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

A person is always advised to have a filling breakfast, a moderately elaborate lunch, but a beggar's dinner. This kind of a balanced diet helps a person to live a way healthier life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The following points will help you to have a healthy dinner facilitating your wellbeing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Opt for a broth instead of something greasy and oily</strong>: If you plan to cook veggies on a pan, chuck the idea of using oil. Oily and greasy food should be your last dinner option. Excess oil not only complicates digestive processes, but it also interferes with your regular sleep patterns. The next solution available is to use vegetable broth in place of oil. Pieces of lean meat or diced vegetables steamed in some broth can make a yummy meal indeed.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try avoiding dairy products after sundown</strong>: It is hard for your body to break down dairy products, such as full cream milk or cheese at night. Dairy products are also fattening. It would be best to have these in the day. Contrary to popular belief, milk is not an essential part of an adult's diet. It is inevitable in your growing age. To fulfill one's bodily requirement of calcium without causing extra pressure on the digestive system, a generous helping of plain yogurt can be had with dinner.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Drink water before you start with your meal</strong>: Water kills your ability to overeat. Many tend to drink soda or carbonated drinks alongside lunch or dinner; this is a bad practice. One may sip on to water while eating a meal, but that too in moderation. You should drink water before sitting at the dining table; this way you can successfully prevent yourself from overeating.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Spices can actually help</strong>: Spice is not a vice. Spices bring added flavor to your food and subject you to the benefits of natural products. May it be a soup, broth or a salad; adding spices can prove to be effective. Cinnamon and turmeric can actually protect you against a host of diseases. Garlic fights off cancer. Using ginger to cook your dinner can also be extremely helpful.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Whole grains pave your way to good health</strong>: Instead of having refined grains you should go in for whole grains. Whole grains are rich in fiber and fills you up for a longer span of time. Fiber can come to your aid if you suffer from chronic constipation as it is known to stimulate bowel movements.</li>\n</ol>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/dinner1475843546172.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"579363ed4c0ab56541be1c26","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"food"},{"text":"dinner"},{"text":"health"},{"text":"breakfast"},{"text":"lunch"},{"text":"balance diet"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"https://www.lybrate.com/topic/tips-for-a-healthy-dinner/9b75ca0097e3dfb98fa80354c56cf1f6","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-07T12:32:46.574Z","udate":"2016-10-08T08:26:57.978Z","expirydate":"2017-10-07T12:32:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f795ee339bda5d32978f63","publishedOn":"2016-10-08T08:26:00.000Z","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"id":"57f795ee339bda5d32978f61","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out2546.mp3","tagsForSearch":"food,dinner,health,breakfast,lunch,balance diet","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

There are different types of dandruff you can suffer from. It be can yellow and sticky or white and flaky. It is a very common condition, which is often the result of exposure to styling products, chronic constipation, stress, fatigue or pollution. A chemical treatment can surely cure the condition but it can also harm your hair as well as have its fair share of side effects.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Here are a few ayurvedic treatments which you could try to treat dandruff:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Coconut oil and camphor: Mix a small portion of camphor with some coconut. Store it in a container and apply it to your scalp every night. The camphor will help cool your scalp, which will help reduce the dandruff.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Coconut and lemon: Lemon is a particular ingredient, which is used for many hair care remedies. Warm up the coconut oil, mix some lemon juice in it and apply it on your scalp. Leave it on for at least half an hour and then wash your hair with shampoo. Perform this remedy at least for two to three weeks.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Curd and gram flour: Take a small bowl of curd and mix two to three teaspoons of gram flour. Add half a spoon of lemon juice in the mixture before applying it on your scalp and leave it for half an hour. Curd and gram flour are considered to be the best cleansers to clean the scalp and one of the best remedies for dandruff.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. Lemon and neem leaves: Take a few neem leaves and make a paste. Add only half of a lemon to the paste and apply the mixture to your scalp. Leave it on for half an hour before washing your hair with shampoo. Follow this for at least two to three weeks.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5. Hot oil massage: A hot oil massage not only gives you relaxation, but also helps a lot with dandruff. Heat up a small amount of oil and massage your scalp with it. The hot oil seeps deeper into the roots of hair.<br />These remedies not only clear your scalp of the dandruff, but they also make your hair soft, smooth and healthy. So go and try them out.</p>\n</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/dandruff1475844045662.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"579363ed4c0ab56541be1c26","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"dandruff"},{"text":"ayurvedic treatment"},{"text":"itching"},{"text":"scalp"},{"text":"chronic constipation"},{"text":"stress"},{"text":"fatigue"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"https://www.lybrate.com/topic/how-to-treat-dandruff-with-ayurveda/a8d9d17a4e1acf483fe21c115c5a58f9","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-07T12:41:06.708Z","udate":"2016-10-07T12:58:16.535Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-07T12:39:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f797e24a8d835943bd3058","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out2505.mp3","tagsForSearch":"dandruff,ayurvedic treatment,itching,scalp,chronic constipation,stress,fatigue","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Everybody craves to have spotless and flawless skin. But usually no one does anything about it. Contrary to popular belief, having perfect skin is not really difficult. You need to religiously follow your skincare regime to keep it healthy and flawless. In case you are suffering from melasma or have skin pigmentation,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here are a few tips which you can follow:</p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li><strong>Apply raw potato on your face:</strong> Take a clean and fresh potato. Cut it into two halves and wet the exposed surface with a little water. Rub this on all the affected regions on the face and wash your face after 10 to 15 minutes with lukewarm water. Potatoes are extremely effective in removing pigmentation as they have an enzyme called catecholase, which can help to lighten darkened areas on the skin.</li>\n<li><strong>Use apple cider vinegar on your skin:</strong> Apple cider vinegar helps to restore the natural color of the skin. It also contains beta-carotene, which helps to treat the damage done to the skin by the atmosphere's free radicals. In fact, one of the famous qualities of apple cider vinegar is to make the skin supple and bright.</li>\n<li><strong>Apply aloe vera on your skin:</strong> Regular usage of aloe vera on the skin is one of the best and most effective remedies for skin pigmentation. Aloe vera can help clean the skin without harming the natural balance of the skin, as it has marvelous cleansing properties. It helps to reduce spots on your face, and also provides protection against the harmful UV rays of the sun.</li>\n<li><strong>A sandalwood pack can also work wonders:</strong> Sandalwood acts, both as a stimulant as well as a blood purifier. These two properties of sandalwood help it to treat skin pigmentation. Make a pack using sandalwood and rosewater and apply it to your face at least twice a day to get rid of the pigmentation. Sandalwood is also one of the major ingredients for a sunscreen as it can protect the skin from the harmful UV rays.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep an eye on what you eat:</strong> Your diet plays a very crucial part when it comes to the wellbeing of your skin. Make sure that you add a lot of green leafy vegetables and foods rich in Vitamin A and C to maintain your healthy skin. Drink lots of water and eat a lot of fruits in order to keep your skin hydrated.

What a fuss everyone made! And then you continued to walk right on through childhood, adolescence, and into adulthood, but somewhere along the way, like most adults, you probably stopped walking so much. In fact, the percentage of adults who spent most of their day sitting increased from 36.8% in 2000 to 39.9% in 2005! Part of the reason may be your hectic, stressful life, with not a moment to spare for recreation or formal <a class=\"quizlink\" title=\"Learning Quiz\" href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/exercise_and_fitness_quiz/quiz.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"quiz\">exercise</a>. The environment plays a part too; inactivity has been engineered into our lives, from escalators to remote controls to riding lawn mowers to robotic vacuum cleaners to electric toothbrushes to the disappearance of sidewalks and safe places to walk. But research shows that all this automation is bad for our health. Inactivity is the second leading preventable cause of death in the United States, second only to <a class=\"slidelink\" href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"slide\" data-title=\"Educational Slideshow\">tobacco</a> use.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You'd think a simple activity like walking would be just that, simple. But fewer than 50% of American adults do enough exercise to gain any health or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/exercise_and_activity/article.htm\" rel=\"dt\">fitness</a> benefits from physical activity. Is walking our salvation? I don't know for sure, but evidence suggests that it's probably a good start.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<h3>What are the top 10 reasons to walk?&nbsp;</h3>\n</div>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li><strong>Walking prevents type 2 diabetes.</strong> The <a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_prevention/article.htm\" rel=\"dt\">Diabetes Prevention</a> Program showed that walking 150 minutes per week and losing just 7% of your body weight (12-15 pounds) can reduce your risk of <a class=\"slidelink\" href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"slide\" data-title=\"Educational Slideshow\">diabetes</a> by 58%.</li>\n<li><strong>Walking strengthens your heart if you're male.</strong> In one study, mortality rates among retired men who walked less than one mile per day were nearly twice that among those who walked more than two miles per day.</li>\n<li><strong>Walking strengthens your heart if you're female.</strong> Women in the Nurse's Health Study (72,488 female nurses) who walked three hours or more per week reduced their risk of a <a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm\" rel=\"dt\">heart attack</a> or other coronary event by 35% compared with women who did not walk.</li>\n<li><strong>Walking is good for your brain.</strong> In a study on walking and cognitive function, researchers found that women who walked the equivalent of an easy pace at least 1.5 hours per week had significantly better cognitive function and less cognitive decline than women who walked less than 40 minutes per week. Think about that!</li>\n<li><strong>Walking is good for your bones.</strong> Research shows that <a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm\" rel=\"dt\">postmenopausal</a> women who walk approximately one mile each day have higher whole-body bone density than women who walk shorter distances, and walking is also effective in slowing the rate of bone loss from the legs.</li>\n<li><strong>Walking helps alleviate symptoms of depression.</strong> Walking for 30 minutes, three to five times per week for 12 weeks reduced symptoms of <a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm\" rel=\"dt\">depression</a> as measured with a standard <a class=\"slidelink\" title=\"Educational Slideshow\" href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"slide\">depression</a>questionnaire by 47%.</li>\n<li><strong>Walking reduces the risk of breast and colon cancer.</strong> Women who performed the equivalent of one hour and 15 minutes to two and a half hours per week of brisk walking had an 18% decreased risk of <a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_facts_stages/article.htm\" rel=\"dt\">breast cancer</a> compared with inactive women. Many studies have shown that exercise can prevent <a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/colon_cancer/article.htm\" rel=\"dt\">colon cancer</a>, and even if an individual person develops colon <a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm\" rel=\"dt\">cancer</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/benefits_of_exercise/article.htm\" rel=\"sub\">benefits of exercise</a> appear to continue both by increasing quality of life and reducing mortality.</li>\n<li><strong>Walking improves fitness.</strong> Walking just three times a week for 30 minutes can significantly increase cardiorespiratory <a class=\"slidelink\" title=\"Educational Slideshow\" href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/exercise_and_fitness_pictures_slideshow/article.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"slide\">fitness</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Walking in short bouts improves fitness, too!</strong> A study of sedentary women showed that short bouts of brisk walking (three 10-minute walks per day) resulted in similar improvements in <a class=\"quizlink\" title=\"Learning Quiz\" href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/exercise_and_fitness_quiz/quiz.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"quiz\">fitness</a> and were at least as effective in decreasing body fatness as long bouts (one 30-minute walk per day).</li>\n<li><strong>Walking improves physical function.</strong> Research shows that walking improves fitness and physical function and prevents physical disability in older persons.</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many of these benefits are probably no surprise. After all, thousands of studies prove that exercise is good for you, and we've been <a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm\" rel=\"dt\">hearing</a> that for years. But in the past decade, exercise scientists have taken a different approach to studying physical activity. Instead of the benefits, they have been looking at the negative aspects of being a couch potato. Study after study shows that sitting is not good for your health or fitness. For example, researchers showed that people who reported sitting \"almost all of the time\" died sooner from&nbsp;<a class=\"slidelink\" title=\"Educational Slideshow\" href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"slide\">cardiovascular disease</a> than people who reported sitting \"almost none of the time,\" &frac14;, &frac12;, or &frac34; of the time, and they did so in what's called a \"dose-response\" manner. This means that the more you sit the more likely you are to die prematurely.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now get this. One study showed that for \"every single hour of television watched after the age of 25 the viewer's life expectancy was reduced by 21.8 minutes\"! And finally, if you've got a desk job, then walking just five minutes per hour during every work day would help you burn approximately 33,000 additional calories per year. Provided you didn't change your <a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm\" rel=\"sub\">diet</a>, the change in walking habit would equate to a loss of body weight of 9.4 pounds at the end of the year! Considering most people gain weight as they get older, you get a big bang for your buck with not so much effort.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/walking1475844473109.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","publisherSectionName":"medicinenet.com","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"walking"},{"text":"exercise"},{"text":"fitness"},{"text":"workout"},{"text":"cardiovascular disease"},{"text":"diet"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.medicinenet.com/walking/article.htm","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-07T12:48:13.659Z","udate":"2016-10-07T12:59:40.775Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-07T12:47:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f7998d5c9c08595eb55a02","publiseherSectionId":"57f7998d5c9c08595eb55a03","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out9391.mp3","tagsForSearch":"walking,exercise,fitness,workout,cardiovascular disease,diet","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

With NASH, inflammation of the liver damages the cells, potentially causing scarring and cirrhosis.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Currently, the diagnosis of NASH can only be done with a liver biopsy, an invasive and costly procedure.

Over time this should lead to improvements in safety during surgeries because unlike their human counterparts robots do not tire and can complete an endless series of precise movements, researchers said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The goal is not to remove human expertise from the operating room, but to complement it with a robot's particular skills and benefits. \"As a roboticist, I am convinced that robotic (co) workers and collaborators will definitely change the work market, but they won't steal job opportunities. They will just allow us to<br />decrease workload and achieve better performances in several tasks, from medicine to industrial applications,\" De Momi said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the experiment, the team photographed a human being conducting numerous reaching motions, in a way similar to handing instruments to a surgeon. These camera captures were input into the neural network of the robotic arm, which is crucial to controlling movements. Next a human operator guided the robotic arm in imitating the reaching motions that the human subject had initially performed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although there was not a perfect overlap between the robotic and human actions, they were broadly similar. Finally, several humans observed as the robotic arm made numerous motions. These observers determined whether the actions of the robotic arms were \"biologically inspired,\" which would indicate that their neural networks had effectively learned to imitate human behaviour.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">About 70 per cent of the time this is exactly what the human observers concluded, researchers said. If robotic arms can indeed imitate human behaviour, it would be necessary to build conditions in which humans and<br />robots can cooperate effectively in high stress environments like operating rooms, they said.

The research challenges the view that the ability to understand unobservable mental states is unique to humans.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the video, a human and a person dressed in an ape suit are engaged in a hide and seek-like scenario. An eye-tracker on a TV monitor follows an observing apes' gaze, recording where the ape anticipates the action will occur next. The video was adapted from a typical false-belief test that indicates whether someone can understand that another's actions are not driven by reality, but by beliefs about reality, even when those beliefs are false.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Human infants only start understanding the concept of false beliefs after they're about four years old,\" said Fumihiro Kano of Kyoto University in Japan. \"Despite their excellent social cognitive skills, great apes consistently failed the false-belief test in previous studies that required them to physically retrieve an object,\" said Kano.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The videos and eye-trackers used for this study, on the other hand, were simplified from a version of the test used previously for human infants and great apes; with this design the great apes need only to sit, stare at the screen, and be passive spectators of test videos. The team, led by Kano and Christopher Krupenye at Duke University, showed this video to chimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans at Kyoto University's Kumamoto Sanctuary and the Max-Planck Institute in Leipzig, Germany.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The apes performed very well, even when compared to human infants and adults,\" said Kano. \"The results indicate that the great apes can predict how the human in the video will make the wrong choice. This shows that apes understand reality-incongruent beliefs, at least when the test subject only needs to watch the video,\" he said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"These findings suggest that this essential human skill - to recognise others' beliefs - may be at least as old as humans' last common ancestor with the other apes, which lived 13 to 18 million years ago,\" said Krupenye. \"This certainly puts to question the notion that the human psyche is unique and superior to other animals,\" added Satoshi Hirata, senior author of the study.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/apes1475901674672.jpeg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baab806a12cf7ee39133b8","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"apes"},{"text":"mental congruence"},{"text":"humans"},{"text":"fumihiro kano"},{"text":"kyoto university"},{"text":"human skill"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/health-and-wellbeing/071016/apes-may-guess-what-others-are-thinking-study.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-08T04:41:38.432Z","udate":"2016-10-08T08:26:57.978Z","expirydate":"2017-10-08T04:41:38.432Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f87902f6280d58e8c2bae0","id":"57f87902f6280d58e8c2bade","publishedOn":"2016-10-08T08:26:00.000Z","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out7998.mp3","tagsForSearch":"apes,mental congruence,humans,fumihiro kano,kyoto university,human skill","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Despite the guidelines, many toddlers in reality use touch screens from a very early age.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tim J. Smith from the University of London realized there is a need for more solid data and set up an online survey for UK parents to answer questions about their children's touch screen use.

It was here, he states, that he began his lifelong research on the mural painting tradition.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been painting since I was a child. I studied Malayalam literature in Kerala, but I was lucky to have received a scholarship and my parents allowed me to go to Santiniketan that changed my whole concept towards life and art. It gave me great clarity. I was fascinated by murals as a child in Kerala, and later I got a chance to study them extensively and learn about our traditions and culture. It was an eye opener and gave me great vision. I started as an angry young man and my earlier works were political as I was a young revolutionary then, and wanted to fight, but over the years, there&rsquo;s been a drift in my works. I believe art is an expression like listening to music,&rdquo; the artist explains of his shift from expressionistic style reflecting the angst of urban life to nature.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He firmly believes that art should be self explanatory and should not require any explanation or have a manifesto. &ldquo;I developed my own philosophy gradually and found a different meaning in my works over the years. I never followed trends and don&rsquo;t like to fit into the tight mould of modernism or post-modernism. I&rsquo;ve never been part of any movement and follow the ideologies of my teachers. I like to combine my influences from literature, folklores, mythology, other painting traditions from India and go to Udaipur and nearby villages every year,&rdquo; shares Ramachandran who&rsquo;s vibrant colours, lyrical figures and depiction of themes binds the aspects of fertility, memory, and nature and have come to define his oeuvre as an artist.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From urban reality, he moved focus towards tribal community life; especially the tribes from Rajasthan, whose lives and culture gripped his imagination.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Delhi-based artist adds, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something about the life and customs in villages, where people live in complete harmony with nature, which I always seek to explore. I&rsquo;m identifying myself as an Indian artist to see what I can do differently than the accepted norm of art and installations. I&rsquo;m a purist and believe in Indian forms of miniatures than the so- called modern art.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>A Retrospective of A.

The soft-spoken ever learning artist has come up with a wonderful collection of paintings at Sublime titled Altered Surfaces by Andrew Paul. This happens to be his first solo show and he is visibly excited at the prospect.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Currently working at an ad agency as a copywriter, he juggles his work and art. For Andrew, a specialist in abstract art, painting is a journey of several emotions, incidents and phases in life which he has encountered. Since childhood, Andrew has always had a keen interest towards all forms of art, specially in paintings, he has studied, researched and learnt a lot from different artists understanding their ways of expression and use of colours.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As years went by, he tried to develop his own style of art in which he expresses his thoughts and expressions in its truest forms &mdash; abstract expressionism. Andrew believes, &ldquo;Art should be a creation of your soul and heart, which in turn should be created in a way that no-one, even your own self cannot recapture its essence.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Recently Andrew&rsquo;s work Mighty My Saviour, got featured in the 2015 edition of the Oxford Encyclopedia of the Bible and the Arts in South Asia. This makes Paul the youngest artist in the country to earn this accolade. As an artist, he always thought that emotions, reactions and feelings of humans were perhaps some of the most powerful forms of expression.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;There has been a constant struggle and battle inside me to create works of art that portray these myriad emotions through various hues, mixes, textures and patterns.&rdquo; says the artist.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Andrew&rsquo;s abstracts have a uniqueness about it. His textures are carefully rendered to give a soothing feel and a lot of his works have a dreamy abstract expressionist feel about them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Andrew&rsquo;s journey has been a voyage of soul searching with a higher motive and mightier goal in mind. All the 23 works of art have a story to tell. Speaking about his most favourite work, Andrew feels it is the Red soul work in which he has depicted a circular red bindu which signifies power and he aims to speak through the work that no matter the circumstances we face in life, we are never overawed and we have the energy to turn the tables. The show marks a nice beginning to the promising career of the artists.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The art show is on at the Sublime Art Gallery till October 29.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/paintings1475902504746.jpeg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baab806a12cf7ee39133b8","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"paintings"},{"text":"maverick artist"},{"text":"andrew paul"},{"text":"altered surfaces"},{"text":"abstract art"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/books-and-art/071016/abstract-in-expression.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-08T04:55:27.983Z","udate":"2016-10-08T08:04:06.935Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-08T04:54:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f87c3fb38e1d5d6a0c32c8","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out2088.mp3","tagsForSearch":"paintings,maverick artist,andrew paul,altered surfaces,abstract art","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
