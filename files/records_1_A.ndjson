Though Kale is packed with antioxidants and other nutrients, it is as healthy as any other green veggie. You won't suffer a health hazard if you don't consume it.</div>\n<div class=\"photo_ftr clearfix\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"photo_ftr clearfix\">\n<div class=\"photo_dtls\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span class=\"img_cptn\">MYTH: Eat fish to get omega-3 fats</span></strong></div>\n<div class=\"cptn_bg\">\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>\n<div class=\"photo_ftr clearfix\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">FACT: The omega-3 family is credited with innumerable health benefits, ranging from promoting brain development in infants to improving heart health in adulthood. Marine-based supplements are the only way to fuel your body with EPA and DHA -two important omega-3 fatty acids. However, walnuts, flaxseed, canola oil, soybeans and some other plant foods offer ALA, a third omega-3 fatty acid. You need all three types of omega-3 fats for optimal health. Studies prove without ALA, you'd have scaly skin and problems with hair growth and wound healing. Diets rich in ALA decrease the risk of fatal ischemic heart disease.But don't depend entirely on it. For optimal health, include both fish and plant-based omega-3 sources in your diet.</div>\n<div class=\"photo_ftr clearfix\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"photo_ftr clearfix\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<div class=\"photo_dtls\"><strong><span class=\"img_cptn\">MYTH: Brown bread is better than the white variety</span></strong></div>\n<div class=\"cptn_bg\">\n<div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>\n<div class=\"photo_ftr clearfix\">FACT: So you reach out to the multi-grain bread at a bakery with a vengeance, thinking it is a better option than the packaged white bread. But the brown bread, like it or not, is the biggest hoax. Various ingredients from coffee to edible color are packed in to give the bread the healthy shade you desire. The sugar content in the bread are the same as white and so is the maida content. Do your health a favor: always look for the words \"100 per cent whole wheat\" or buy it from a trusted neighborhood bakery.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"photo_ftr clearfix\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"photo_ftr clearfix\">\n<div class=\"photo_dtls\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span class=\"img_cptn\">MYTH: Eat cake be happy</span></strong></div>\n<div class=\"cptn_bg\">\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<div id=\"content54347380\" class=\"photo_blocknew\" data-title=\" MYTH: Eat cake be happy\" data-url=\"/life-style/health-fitness/7-diet-myths-no-one-told-you-about/-MYTH-Eat-cake-be-happy/photostory/54347380.cms\">\n<div class=\"photo_block\">\n<div class=\"photo_desc photo_desc_prnt height\">\n<div class=\"photo_desc height\"><span class=\"readmore_span\">FACT: It is a misnomer that a plate of fried onion bhajiyas is going to banish the monsoon blues. You think that cake when you feel lonely will make you feel better? Well, no. The idea that we can feel better by simply consuming certain foods is appealing, but in reality, feeling better has nothing to do with the food. It's a weak psychological effect. The comfort foods we turn to the most are the ones we ate while growing up, or the ones that remind us of `happy occasions'.

Heard this before? Large studies suggest that this theory is all wrong. The famous Framingham Heart Study, which first showed that high blood cholesterol causes heart attacks, found no connection between eating eggs and cardiovascular disease. It turns out that about 25 per cent of the cholesterol in your blood comes from food.<br />The other 75 per cent is manufactured by the liver, which produces lots of cholesterol when you eat cheeseburgers and other sources of saturated fat -something eggs are low in. Eggs are filled with useful nutrients that may offset any damage done by their cholesterol content, including unsaturated fat, folate and other B vitamins and minerals. So, next time don't guilt yourself into eating a plate of scrambled eggs for breakfast.</div>\n<div class=\"photo_ftr clearfix\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"photo_ftr clearfix\">\n<div class=\"photo_dtls\"><strong><span class=\"img_cptn\">MYTH: Eating protein builds muscle</span></strong></div>\n<div class=\"photo_dtls\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"cptn_bg\">\n<div>FACT: To build muscle, you must have three key components: adequate calories, a decent intake of protein and a good strength training programme. Without enough calories, some of the dietary protein will be used as an energy source. Likewise, protein intake beyond your needs will either be stored as fat or burnt for energy. The timing of your protein is important. After resistance training, consuming a rich source of protein such as cheese, along with some carbohydrate has been shown to build muscle. To build muscle, you need to eat a healthy diet, which includes a normal amount of protein, and train regularly.&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"photo_ftr clearfix\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"photo_ftr clearfix\">\n<div class=\"photo_dtls\"><strong><span class=\"img_cptn\">MYTH: Nutrition bars are healthy</span></strong></div>\n<div class=\"cptn_bg\">\n<div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>\n<div class=\"photo_ftr clearfix\">FACT: Most packaged nutrition bars are loaded with synthetic ingredients. These products contain artificial flavors, sweeteners and toxic chemicals you shouldn't consume. Typically, low sugar bars contain either sucralose or sugar alcohols. Sucralose, originally invented as a pesticide, is just sugar bleached by the toxic chemical chlorine. Meanwhile, sugar alcohols, such as maltitol and erythritol, are made from GMO corn and can cause digestive problems and allergic reactions.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/myths1475906257460.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baa979cabe7a5704419047","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"food"},{"text":"diet"},{"text":"nutritional myths"},{"text":"diet myths"},{"text":"fitness"},{"text":"healthy living"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/7-diet-myths-no-one-told-you-about/photostory/54347417.cms","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-08T05:57:44.235Z","udate":"2016-10-08T08:26:57.978Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-08T08:26:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f88ad8f6280d58e8c2bbcf","id":"57f88ad8f6280d58e8c2bbcd","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","tagsForSearch":"food,diet,nutritional myths,diet myths,fitness,healthy living","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

It was a gift he had. I knew Yusuf for well over three decades &mdash; to write about him in the past tense now doesn&rsquo;t seem right. He was so full of life.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">We would meet often at <em>Coffee House</em>, near <em>Deccan Herald</em>, where I began my career. My knowledge of art then was book-based and Western-oriented. Yusuf didn&rsquo;t speak a lot about art, preferring to talk football and cricket. He seemed to know everybody, from the waiters to the customers. Over the years I stopped being surprised at the energy he had to meet people and develop relationships.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">When I returned to Bangalore after a couple of decades working outside, much had changed. But not Yusuf. He had become more celebrated and far more successful, but then in his mind even in the early days he was already a celebrated, successful artist. It was an amazing self-confidence that was nurtured in straitened circumstances &mdash; he once took me to a pokey restaurant in Shivajinagar where he said he had cleaned tables in his struggling days.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now he was also a writer on art, having travelled the world and sieved the experiences through his sharpened sensibilities. He was happy he had known my wife, Dimpy, and myself both separately and together. For a while, he visited us every Sunday morning in his Jeep, just to chat. When he had completed a new work, he invited us to his studio. He had become a one-man industry, supporting whole families with his work. His generosity was legendary, as was his compassion.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yusuf was master of atmosphere, bringing a texture to his paintings and a technique which was a version of Rembrandt&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Yes, Rembrandt is my hero, I try to paint like him,&rdquo; he said. They shared something else too. Both died on the same day, October 4.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He put Bangalore on the art map, as much by his own work as by encouraging young artists. He expected nothing in return save that they listened to his stories, of which he had plenty. Like a gifted raconteur, he improved the stories with time and circumstance.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">On one occasion when he came home, two artists were visiting. R.B. Bhaskaran and Achuthan Kudallur. Somehow they decided to do a work apiece in our living room which had canvases by them and others. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have a Yusuf Arakkal,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do something about it?&rdquo; responded my wife. Later he gave me a small canvas he had done of Sachin Tendulkar.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">On another occasion, we were at a book release function when I noticed a book by David Hockney which I planned to buy later. But someone bought it before the end of the show. Next morning Yusuf arrived at home with that book as a gift. Somehow he had known.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The world of art will miss a major artist. I miss my friend.

{"_id":"57f89083339bda5d329791ea","title":"Finding beauty in subtlety","subtitle":"Parwati Dutta, who is a practitioner of both Kathak and Odissi, refuses to use her art for worldly meanings. She moved away from Delhi to the arid regions of Aurangabad, to work for the Mahagami Gurukul","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trained in Kathak and Odissi by doyens like Pt. Birju Maharaj, Kelucharan Mohapatra and Madhavi Mudgal, Pawrati Dutta has carved a niche for herself in the world of classical dance. Her passion for Kathak, especially Dhrupad, has led her to dig deep into the history of this form, which she now shares with young, budding dancers.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">This versatile dancer, was in Bengaluru for a five-day workshop for senior dancers. She talks to Friday Review about her passion for the form, especially Dhrupad. Parwati has also been instrumental in setting up Mahagami Gurukul, in Aurangabad, where she has been spearheading dance training and sensitisation programmes in some of the remotest pockets of the country. That is not all she has also taken dance to prisons, to encourage inmates to take to dancing. She started learning when she was a teen and Parwati goes back in time to share her journey through dance.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Excerpts:</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>You have learnt Odissi and Kathak, did the two styles not clash with each other? They are so different in style....</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Odissi has always been my search. I find Kathak and Odissi very similar, especially the Kathak that I do &ndash; the <em>thhat, uthaan</em> , the pure dance and the dhrupad &ndash; are all so lyrical. It is we have who have changed Kathak to become a rhythmically charged form. But I feel the soul of Kathak is still lyrical. It is like the Khadi fabric, subtle and beautiful. Learning two dance forms is like learning two languages. When you know your mother tongue and learn a new language, you rediscover your own language. The same way Odissi has helped me analyse Kathak better. I find myself more educated as I can pinpoint subtle movements in the body.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What do you feel about such workshops, which teach not just the dance form but also its rich history? Should there be more such as holistic efforts?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">They are not done these days. This is my first trip to Bengaluru, where I have come to ignite young minds. It is a process-oriented and not a result-oriented workshop. This is my way of sharing my years of research and study with younger dancers. Majorly workshops are shallow.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">I don&rsquo;t believe in the rat race, even when it comes to having a number of students. Instead, I left it -- moved out of Delhi where I was thriving to Aurangabad to work with Mahagami.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Tell us more about Mahagami.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was there from the time of its inception. It&rsquo;s been 20 years since it started. I feel I was destined to go there and work with the marginalised people. It was a random decision. It was a stretch of a barren land. I was discouraged when I was invited to teach there. But I took it up as a challenge.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was the beginning of a new story in my life and for many others. Now it has grown. The saplings that were planted by me are now part of a lush green campus. Over the years I have trained over 2,000 dancers. Aurangabad was not ready for Mahagami. So I had to counsel the parents and help them understand the nuances and the rich history of Kathak.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What do you mean when you say a dancer has to have the responsibility towards the form?</strong></p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">To realise that the dance has to nurture you and your individualistic expressions. But the responsibility has to pass on to the next generation in all your honesty.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you buy a car, you plant a tree. These are rules you have to set for yourself. We still have to consult experts, learn from them and pass on the rich heritage for generations to come.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">***</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Perfect moves</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The recently-held workshop by Parwati Dutta covered many historical and social nuances of Kathak</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A long drive took us to IGNCA (Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, Southern Regional Centre), where renowned Kathak dancer -- Parwati Dutta &ndash; concluded her intense week-long workshop for senior students in the city.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Organised by Gramsci Foundation, a Bengaluru-based Art trust and IGNCA, the workshop had around 12 students who tried to imitate her moves.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">They start off by reciting the taals verbally and then try to recreate the same rhythm with their feet. The tempo goes from slow to fast. Soft-spoken Parwati is a task master. She makes her students repeat the moves till she is satisfied with every look, footwork and the final hand gesture. The workshop was not just dance, but also about the legacy of Kathak. &ldquo;It is a very subtle form,&rdquo; she says gesturing her students to sit down for a while. &ldquo;Kathak is just like cooking that perfect meal. You cook with love. Even adding one pinch of extra salt can ruin the taste. Similarly, there need not be any exaggerated moves.&rdquo; She cites the example of a tiny leaf swaying softly in a light breeze. &ldquo;That leaf moving has its own significance. The beauty lies in that subtlety,&rdquo; she adds.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;When I was young, we would take our books and pens as we would learn so much from each festival. We had festivals dedicated to only dhrupad or khayals. So we would have many Kathak dancers, who would come and present their choreographies on these.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Did you know that the first reference of kathak was in the Mahabharat?

Santhanagopalan, a popular and veteran musician in the field, got connected to the knowledgeable music lovers in this area of East Delhi no sooner than he started his concert. Indeed, it turned out to be a delightful evening of Carnatic music, both for the audience as well as the artistes.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Santhanagopalan started his concert with the Adi Tala Varnam &ldquo;Inta Chalamu&rdquo; in the raga Begada in two speeds in a befitting manner. The invocation song on Lord Ganesha was Muthuswami Dikshitar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Panchamatanga&rdquo; in raga Malahari. The song was suffixed with detailed kalpanaswaras. For the Tyagaraja&rsquo;s composition &ldquo;Telisi Ramachintanato&rdquo; in raga Poornachandrika, which Santhanagopalan took up subsequently, he introduced neraval and kalpanaswaras.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Santhanagopalan also sang Tyagaraja&rsquo;s &ldquo;Eti jenmamidi&rdquo; in raga Varali and &ldquo;Bagayanayya&rdquo; in raga Chandrajyoti in an emotive manner bringing out the emotive contents of the lyrics to the fore. He also sang the slow pace Muthuswami Dikshitar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ranganayakam&rdquo; to a riveting tempo and in a delightful manner.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Being in the midst of Navratri festival, as expected, Santhanagopalan&rsquo;s central item of recital was on Goddess Devi. The choice of Muthuswami Dikshitar&rsquo;s navavarana kriti &ldquo;Kamalambam Bhajare&rdquo; in raga Kalyani was thoughtful. Till then, though there was a sumptuous quota of compositions, the raga alapanas were not. The only raga alapana that came in for detailed delineation was Kalyani. Sadly, many phrases in the delineation were a mere swara combinations and these did not quite help in bringing out the complete features of the raga to the fore.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Delhi R. Sridhar on the violin, Kumbakonam N. Padmanabhan on the mridangam rose to the occasion and provided good support. N.

{"_id":"57f891ca339bda5d329791f6","title":"Melange of moods","subtitle":"From cosmic dance to a Sanskrit farce, The Parampara Series-2016 brought alive the rich diversity of our cultural heritage, says Ranee Kumar","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In its 20th edition, The Parampara Series, true to its title, offered a dramatic legacy in the form of &ldquo;Bhagavadajjukeeyam&rdquo;, revisiting it after more than two decades. The festival was a varied platter where Manipuri and creative dance, not to talk of Carnatic classical vocal and Hindustani vocal met on the same platform.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hosted at Kamani auditorium, day one saw Natya Tarangini&rsquo;s production, a reconceptualisation of an early Telugu adaptation of Bodhayana&rsquo;s (12th Century) Sanskrit farce, &ldquo;Bhagavadajjukeeyam&rdquo;. Sketched out on Kuchipudi Bhagavatha mela canvas, this farcical comedy had all the elements that went with a Kuchipudi dance drama from Pravesha daruvu to tera (customary entry-exit behind a hand-held cloth screen) to comic relief in the character of Shandilya, a negative character &ndash; Yamadhoot and a redeeming character &ndash; the Buddhist monk, and finally the moral of the story. The lyrics of the songs set to classical raga were reminiscent of the traditional Bhama Kalapam. The only difference lay in the subject and its treatment.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be it the backdrop, aharya (hairdo, make-up and costume) or the scenes and, of course, the dance form, aesthetics has always been the forte of Guru Raja Reddy. So, it was with this crisp yet complete dance drama. The introduction to the principal characters through silhouettes on manually placed framed screens sucked us into the production . In a nutshell, the story is about Vasantasena, a courtesan, who is bitten by a serpent sent by Yamdoot as her time is up on earth. She falls dead only to be resuscitated to life by Parivrajaka, a Buddhist monk of great power and wisdom to appease his grief-stricken, love-lorn disciple Shandilya. The ancient Indian practice of &lsquo;Parakaya (another body) pravesh (entry) is revoked by the monk to breathe life into the maiden. The farcical element comes to the fore now when the Yamdoot realises he made a big mistake in walking away with the life force of the wrong candidate (Vasantasena) and tries to rectify. The comic element gets compounded with Vasantasena&rsquo;s soul being put in the dead monk and then it is all&rsquo;s well that ends well.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bhavana Reddy as Shandilya with shaven hair, probationary monk costume and looks turned up as a marvellous actor with her histrionics. Her natural mirth gleaming in her eyes; the candour and comfort with which she slipped into the role of an infatuated boy &ndash; a comment on immature boys taking to Buddhism &ndash; underlined her potential and immense talent.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yamini, a gifted dancer with a keen sense of rhythm and intrinsic vivacity with footwork to the most complicated mnemonics was suitable for the role of courtesan Vasantasena. Her coy expressive face and darting glances enhanced the character further. Rashmi Vaidyanathan as Yamdoot oozed energy, looking artistically as realistic as her role called for.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The artist of the evening was Guru Raja Reddy himself who was Buddhist monk personified. He literally stole the show with his virtuosity, more so as a monk with the heart and behaviour of a courtesan which sent the audience into peals of laughter. Certain artistic details like the &lsquo;prokshan&rsquo; (a group of dancers with pots and leaf in hand sanctifying by sprinkling water) of the stage after the introduction to characters, put the stamp of authenticity to this Kuchipudi ballet.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Day two brought Manipuri dance, &ldquo;Maha Raas&rdquo; by the pupils of Wangkhem Lokendrajit Singh. The invocation to Devi Katyayani to bestow a life-partner as perfect as Nanda&rsquo;s son (Krsna) by a group of gopis and their dance to the chant of this verse as they move in circles and create aesthetic patterns made for an aesthetic beginning. The typical upper body lift and sway was missing in the girls of this group barring one or two but the redeeming feature came in the form of Krsna, a young girl dressed in Manipuri style and Kalindi, a boy dancer. Krsna danced his way into the hearts of the viewers with his light-footed, swivelling movements, his fleeting rear looks and mischievous eye expressions. So was Kalindi though the serpent movement wasn&rsquo;t actually there, he did gyrate a little and the combat between the two was a wonderful piece of artistry.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The final day saw Samudra group&rsquo;s creative (contemporary) dance which was simply incredible. The team of dancers led by Madhu and Vakkom used their body kinetics, the choreography as such, the costumes, to create an energetic dance which was in absolute rhythm. Not a hair moved out of place as dancers in twos, threes and fours twirled the floor with gesticulations and artistic acrobatics which kept us engrossed. Postures, muscle movements, piercing looks, rigorous footwork formed the hallmark of this troupe.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thoughtful lighting, Vedic chants and background music based on classical raga enriched the presentation, &ldquo;Cosmic dance of Shiva&rdquo;. Kudos to the choreographer who envisaged a theme that presented an esoteric concept of Shiva rather than a Puranic fable. Madhu as Shiva with his curly mop of hair and bare chest and torso looked the &lsquo;real&rsquo; as against the celluloid lord we are used to watching on television and movie screens. The tandavam was exceptional but then so were the Ardhanareeshwar dance and others that followed. A pattern was set that concentrated and consecrated the supreme power and the dance with its vigour and verve fortified the abstract making for a concrete picture. Absence of narration or dialogue or songs was never felt since the dance movements more than spoke the unspoken word.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/musicc1475908035532.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babcefb210157e920b07f9","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"ranee kumar"},{"text":"the parampara series-2016"},{"text":"sanskrit"},{"text":"diversity"},{"text":"cultural heritage"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/melange-of-moods/article9193476.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-08T06:27:22.125Z","udate":"2016-10-08T08:01:28.582Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-08T06:26:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f891ca339bda5d329791f8","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out7717.mp3","tagsForSearch":"ranee kumar,the parampara series-2016,sanskrit,diversity,cultural heritage","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

The tragic shooting at Orlando, and Brexit exemplify how intolerance and divisiveness are spreading their tentacles across either side of the Atlantic. Closer home, the racial attacks against Africans in Delhi suggest that India, despite its rich diversity and famed hospitality, also harbours deep prejudices. Ironically, as globalisation and the Internet have in some sense erased geographic boundaries, xenophobic tendencies are only growing more pronounced in various pockets all around the world. Even as we connect with anyone from anywhere, we are more wary of the &lsquo;other.&rsquo; But diversity, in all its myriad hues, actually benefits both individuals and societies. So, we must fight the narrow forces that push for homogeneity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In an article published in The New York Times<em>,</em><em>&nbsp;</em>in December 2015, researchers Sheen Levine and David Stark describe a set of experiments that suggest that ethnic and racial diversity enhances the decision-making abilities of people. By simulating a stock market in diverse versus homogenous groups, the researchers were able to study the impact of diversity. When participants were in a diverse group, they were 58% per cent more accurate in determining the true value of stocks. According to the authors, ethnic diversity, be it in Texas or Singapore where the study was conducted, allowed people to make better decisions. When participants were in an ethnically homogenous group, they tended to mimic the behaviour of other participants, often copying their mistakes as well. On the other hand, in a diverse group, people tended to be more discerning and less likely to follow the crowd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In a 2012 issue of&nbsp;<em>Observer</em>, scholars Douglas Medin and Carol Lee argue that apart from concerns over for social equality, diversity has an elemental role to play in the sciences. Multiple perspectives at all stages of the scientific enterprise, from choosing what to study, methods one adopts, to interpreting results, can provide new insights. For example, they cite the work of Sarah Hrdy who makes the point that when female primatologists entered the field, fresh insights regarding primate behaviour emerged.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Another example of the merits of a different viewpoint is the work of Temple Grandin who came up with an ingenious and humane method for livestock handling and slaughter. Grandin, who has autism, has extraordinary visualization skills. She attributes the success of her unconventional design that transformed the livestock industry to her ability to see the process from the perspective of cattle. In an interview, published in the Daily Mail in 2011, Grandin says, &ldquo;It was important to see what the cattle see, so I could address what made them anxious.&rdquo;d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In an article published in Scientific American in 2014, Professor Katherine Phillips, who teaches at Columbia Business School, argues that diversity entails more than just bringing to the table, different perspectives. In fact, knowing that others in a group may not share beliefs or viewpoints, compels individuals to change their behaviour. She cites a 2006 study conducted by social psychologist Samuel Sommers that involved mock jury trials. When the juries had mixed races, jurors were more deliberate in their discussion and more open to considering the role of race in the case. In addition, they were more accurate in recalling facts of the case.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Thus, Phillips argues that diversity compels us to work harder. Just by being in a diverse group, we expect others to think differently from us, and are more prepared to address alternative viewpoints. As Phillips writes, &ldquo;People work harder in diverse environments,&rdquo; which can &ldquo;lead to better outcomes.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">To be a truly open society, we need to embrace diversity in all forms. Language, religion, race, gender and sexual orientation are only some of the dimensions on which human beings differ. Being gay, author Andrew Solomon always thought that he belonged to &ldquo;a fairly slim minority.&rdquo; In his book, Far from the Tree, he says that as he encountered people from other marginalised groups, from the deaf to dwarfs and child prodigies, he had an epiphany and realised that &ldquo;Difference unites us.&rdquo; In fact, if we take all types of differences into account, we realise that the &ldquo;exceptional is ubiquitous.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Indeed, if we embrace an truly open outlook and are open and accepting of differences, we realise that we find more commonalities with people from other groups, however, we may choose to define &lsquo;group.&rsquo; After all, we all have multiple identities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">So, while I am a woman, an Indian and a psychologist, I also have affinities with book lovers, tea drinkers and&nbsp;<em>The Good Wife</em><em>&nbsp;</em>fans. But regardless of our affiliations, we can broaden our horizons, both at the individual and societal levels, by interacting with people who are &lsquo;different&rsquo; from us.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Leaving our comfort zone to mingle with those who are not exactly like us, can indeed enrich us.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Following the recent terrorist attack in a Dhaka caf&eacute;, Anne Bernard writes in The New York Times, that the &ldquo;global mood increasingly feels like one of atavism, of retreat into narrower identities of nation, politics or sect&hellip;&rdquo; Given this bleak scenario, perhaps, we should all make a concerted effort to befriend and celebrate the &lsquo;other.&rsquo;</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><u>Aruna Sankaranarayanan</u></strong></span></li>\n</ul>","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out8446.mp3","tagsForSearch":"orlando indecent,brexit,globalization","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

I began working as a freelance journalist when I was 17, picking up assignments from local magazines and newspapers. I was a fashion editor for several years, lived in London and Paris for a while, and then moved to Los Angeles in 2000, when I got married. I&rsquo;ve never stopped writing, whether it was features for magazines or novels,&rdquo; she shares.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Her recently released book Kingpin is the story of a 26-year-old business tycoon Anil Raichand, who is young, handsome and one of the most sought-after bachelors in society. Unfolding over four decades, the book takes the reader on a journey tracing Anil&rsquo;s boyhood in Singapore to his foray into the Bombay marriage market, his falling in love with the wrong lady and his meteoric rise and fall in Dubai.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Giving an insight into the main protagonist of her book, she says, &ldquo;Anil Raichand is an amalgamation of various men I&rsquo;ve encountered over the years, fictionalised. I wanted to create somebody who was very much under the control of his parents, who lived his life according to their expectations of him, and society&rsquo;s as well. He was born with wealth and privilege, and he measures himself by what he can accumulate. He does a lot of things for wrong reasons.&rdquo; This is Kavita&rsquo;s eighth novel, and interestingly her first one where the story is told primarily from a man&rsquo;s point of view. &ldquo;I wanted to create a story about a man who has everything &mdash; money, looks, pedigree, smartness &mdash; but somehow manages to spectacularly mess things up,&rdquo; she says.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Kingpin by Kavita Daswani Speaking Tiger pp.248, Rs 299</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">The author likes to keep the themes simple and relatable. &ldquo;My main characters have always been Indian, the stories have always been cross-cultural, generally light, vaguely memoirish, and I try to fill them with warmth. I marvel at the skill of, say, historical fiction writers who spend years researching about a time period, country or culture,&rdquo; says the author who loves contemporary fiction. &ldquo;I recently read Elizabeth Gilbert&rsquo;s The Signature of All Things, which I&nbsp; couldn&rsquo;t put down. I never thought I&rsquo;d be interested in a story about a 19th century female botanist, but it was so gorgeous and moving and evocative and it&rsquo;s one of the best things I&rsquo;ve ever read,&rdquo; she adds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Summarising her writing process, Kavita says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mystery, the whole process. It is impossible for any writer to explain how they get to where they are going. It is an odd alchemy of luck, timing, and hope that imagination will strike, and sometimes, no matter what you do, it does not. I never know where a book is going when I start it, or maybe I do but then I change it anyway. There are some authors who are assiduous note-keepers and planners. I&rsquo;m not among them, although I wish I was. It would probably make my life a lot easier to jot something down, instead of me trying to rummage around in my memory for a great thought I had two days earlier.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Flexing her creative muscles, Kavita already has an idea brewing in her mind.

{"_id":"57f8aa2d339bda5d32979331","title":"How to avoid sleep wrinkles","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e65af76df6bbfd6adf3","content":"<p>It&rsquo;s the end of another long day. After juggling your myriad duties and commitments, you look forward to winding down and getting some blissful, restful sleep. But here is something most people do not know: the second most rampant cause of wrinkles after UV exposure is sleeping or more accurately, the position you sleep in.</p>\n<div>Sleep has always been associated with beauty and with good reason. It&rsquo;s during those restful hours that our body rejuvenates and repairs itself. 7-8 hours of good, deep sleep is the elixir that can work wonders on your health and of-course your skin. Beauty sleep is definitely more than just skin deep.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>However, pressing your face into a pillow for over 2500 hours a year can mean that you unwittingly may be ironing some wrinkles into your skin. These are called sleep wrinkles. Sleep wrinkles appear as lines on your face as a result of you pressing your face into a pillow. Over a period of time, these lines become more prominent and permanent. Young skin is better equipped to deal with them, but they don&rsquo;t disappear as easily on mature skin. Botox as a solution is ineffective, because here&rsquo;s another thing most people don&rsquo;t know: Botox only works on expression wrinkles not sleep wrinkles.</div>\n<p>So where on the one hand sound sleep is important, nay necessary, the position you sleep in also plays a pivotal role in the health of your skin. If you are not careful or made aware, get ready to welcome some sleep wrinkles.</p>\n<div><strong>The Side Sleeper</strong><br />In this position, one side of your face is consistently and constantly pressed against your pillow. This causes vertical wrinkle lines to appear on the face. If this is your preferred sleeping position, as it is mine, try positioning you&rsquo;re your head on the pillow so that the lower half of your face, (below the nose), doesn&rsquo;t touch the pillow. This helps to prevent the nasolabial fold, or those lines that run from the nostril to the outer corners of the mouth, from developing.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p><strong>The Stomach Sleeper</strong><br />In this position, the entire face is buried into the pillow. This means that all the moisture from the face gets absorbed into the pillow, leaving the skin dry and wrinkly and prone to clogged pores and blemishes. Not only that, this position is also considered bad for the entire body structure. So all you tummy sleepers may seriously want to consider flipping over.</p>\n<div><strong>The Back Sleeper</strong><br />In this position, the face does not touch the pillow at all making it the best position to avoid sleep wrinkles. Since the face doesn&rsquo;t touch the pillow, no creases are made on the face from pillow contact; there is neither loss of moisture nor any dirt from the pillow being transferred onto the skin hence making it less prone to acne.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Changing your sleep position is tricky. All of us tend to slip back into our favorite positions to get that much-needed and well-deserved rest. But over time and with some effort, we can break old habits and get ourselves into the perfect position to enjoy healthier skin for longer. But no matter how much time and effort it takes or whether we are successful at all, remember to always enjoy the skin you are in and stay Beauty Eternal.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>By Divya Mehta</div>\n<div>The author is co founder of mature skincare brand Epique, Switzerland</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/sleep1475914278729.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf57b58d3f458eaf44895","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"how to avoid sleep wrinkles"},{"text":"sleep wrinkles appear"},{"text":"the back sleeper"},{"text":"the stomach sleeper"},{"text":"the side sleeper"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Life-Style/2016-08-16/How-to-avoid-sleep-wrinkles/248795","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-08T08:11:25.251Z","udate":"2016-10-08T08:26:57.978Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-08T08:26:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f8aa2d339bda5d32979333","id":"57f8aa2d339bda5d32979331","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out8396.mp3","tagsForSearch":"how to avoid sleep wrinkles,sleep wrinkles appear,the back sleeper,the stomach sleeper,the side sleeper","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

But the sparks die out soon. Worse, nothing really changes. And nothing will, unless&nbsp;everyone, both men and women, are sensitised to gender justice. And this begins with&nbsp;education. But the sparks die out in a day or two, and women across the country are forced to go out into the world at their own peril. As more Indian women complete university-level education and enter the workforce, the need for gender sensitisation is imperative. In a first of its kind in the country, a textbook on gender sensitisation,&nbsp;Towards a World of Equals: a Bilingual Textbook on Gender, is being will be taught at the undergraduate level in engineering and pharmacy colleges affiliated to Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (JNTU) in Hyderabad for 2015-16. The reader-friendly curriculum material in the textbook has articles, stories, statistics and personal accounts that raise of people, all raising gender questions, says Shailaja Ramaiyer, in-charge vice-chancellor in-charge of JNTU.</em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">&ldquo;Gender sensibility is an important issue. After the new textbook was introduced, there was healthy deliberation by on the part of the university faculty. Some even suggested that issues concerning harassment of men too also need to be addressed. This kind of reaction is a healthy sign; it would have been a problem if they did not react. Everybody is in the engaging process now,&rdquo; says Ms. Ramaiyer. Acclaimed writer and women&rsquo;s rights<em>&nbsp;activist&nbsp;</em>Susie Tharu, one of the authors of the textbook, says such initiatives stem from growing concerns about the way society perceives women.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Excerpts from an interview:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What has been the response to the new textbook?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">I had not imagined there would be such consensus on this issue. I am surprised the textbook and the JNTU course have received such a resounding welcome.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>To what extent can a textbook change mindsets?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">I get asked this question all the time. The answer is obvious: no book can ever change a mindset. All we can do is introduce students to new ideas, get them thinking about equality, and create a classroom culture where such issues can be comfortably discussed. For instance, one of the chapters in the textbook is titled &lsquo;My mother does not work&rsquo;. It deals with the &lsquo;invisible labour&rsquo; that women engage in everywhere. Why are men expected to only &lsquo;help&rsquo; women with household chores and not &lsquo;share&rsquo; the work? The book has been designed to give scope for such discussions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Why is the book being introduced only in engineering colleges? Why not in all undergraduate colleges?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Well, JNTU made the decision to introduce a course and prescribed this book. But I am sure similar courses will soon be taught in other colleges too. It also has to do with employment opportunities. Global companies are looking for people who can work comfortably in a &lsquo;flat&rsquo; rather than hierarchical cultures. No employer wants the adverse publicity a sexual harassment case can bring them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Do you feel this subject should be introduced in schools too?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">I am not sure. But if you look carefully at the new school textbooks, gender-related issues are now being discussed in language and literature books. My own sense is that schools need to deal with issues of equality in practical ways. There should be activities in which girls and boys work together as equals. School rules should not discriminate between them. In short, schools and families help by setting up a culture that makes gender equality feel natural.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Did parents have any role in the process of syllabus preparation for the JNTU course?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">We did not actually go out and consult parents while preparing the book. But nearly all the authors are parents too, and we brought our perspectives as parents into the making of the book. I am delighted to learn that parents are reading our textbook and the issues are being discussed over meals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">What kind of orientation is being given to teachers who handle the course?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">This is a real problem. We like to think that those who volunteer to teach this course are already invested in these issues. Orientation courses can provide them with in-depth information and help them manage classroom discussions. I should also say that I am surprised at the support the course has received from teachers of different subjects. And it has also generated a lot of interest outside the university.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Is it safe to say that society is ready for a transformation in traditional gender roles?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Gender roles have already changed a great deal. Nearly half the students (42 per cent) in colleges today are women. Parents from all socio-economic groups are sending their daughters to school and college. Women have entered almost every sphere of work and are at the top in many professions. They are out on the streets, driving vehicles, travelling late, and taking calculated risks. They are working hard, but also having fun. More men today share household work and are involved in bringing up children. I am not saying everything is fine. There is a dark side too. But the bright side looks promising.</span></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/20SM_SUSIE_THARU_2788644g1475914367835.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babcefb210157e920b07f9","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"sb vijaya mary"},{"text":"shailaja ramaiyer"},{"text":"jntu"},{"text":"hyderabad"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd0990a438e57c3bf1c3bd","status":"Published","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-08T08:12:56.225Z","udate":"2016-10-10T05:22:40.780Z","expirydate":"2017-01-01T08:09:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-08T08:09:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f8aa88f2efff597a3964f0","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out4116.mp3","tagsForSearch":"sb vijaya mary,shailaja ramaiyer,jntu,hyderabad","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

{"_id":"57f8accb339bda5d32979367","title":"Book Review: A Long Watch – War, Captivity and Return in Sri Lanka","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb900dea63af2cd0d814cf","content":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In the seven years since the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were vanquished, some excellent works of non-fiction have emerged out of Sri Lanka telling the stories of people on both sides of the civil war whose lives were destroyed or disrupted. Commodore Ajith Boyagoda's&nbsp;<em>A Long Watch: War, Captivity and Return in Sri Lanka</em><em>&nbsp;</em>is the story of a soldier, held prisoner of war for eight years by the Tamil Tigers, first as a trophy catch to parade before their compatriots and international media, and later as a bargaining chip to secure the release of jailed rebels. In the eight years he spent in captivity, Boyagoda not just faced loss of freedom, he missed out on his children's growing up years and his career never recovered from the ignominy of losing his ship and the insinuations of professional incompetency.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">My initial circumspection about reading a Sinhala ranking soldier's memoir gave way to surprise and finally heartfelt appreciation for a man who unwaveringly appealed to the humanitarian instincts of his captors, and on most occasions, met with success. In Boyagoda's eyes, the \"dreaded\" Tamil Tigers morphed into ordinary people caught in a cruel war that none of them were responsible for triggering or could escape. Boyagoda's narrative is commendable because it eschews the majoritarian bias that vitiated the island nation's politics, society and vital institutions, the armed forces and media.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In 1994, with two decades of service in the Navy, Boyagoda was commandeering the SLNS Sagarawardene, which was patrolling the north-eastern coast along the Gulf of Mannar when a suicide boat ploughed into it. An ambush by gunboats belonging to the LTTE's naval wing ensued, but with the ship sinking and many of his crew already drowned, Boyagoda was the last to leave the Sagarawardene and captured by the Tigers after drifting in a raft for over half an hour.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">When captured in 1994, Boyagoda claims he was spared harsh, and perhaps even capital punishment because the Tigers were aware of his exemplary conduct as a naval officer. Placed in charge of Karainagar island after the Sri Lankan army invaded it in 1991, he ensured that the Tamil inhabitants of the island were treated with dignity and compassion. As Boyagoda was passed on from one jailor to the next, the treatment he received would oscillate wildly from compassion to hostility. Boyagoda sought to understand the human instincts and the dehumanising experiences that triggered such behaviour among his jailors. He learned to make the best of the circumstances for himself and fellow prisoners of war, who deferred more to his dignified acceptance of his situation, rather than his rank and erstwhile station in life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The perversities of prison life did come to haunt Boyagoda. He was perpetually in chains, which were removed only during the monthly visit to the Red Cross office. From giving out orders while commanding a naval ship, Boyagoda was reduced to taking permission to use the rudimentary bathroom and toilet facilities he shared with fellow prisoners. Later, after release, he writes of moments when he would wait before undertaking even the most routine of tasks, because he had become habituated to taking orders. The Tigers were not averse to testing Boyagoda's resolve. Freedom was only a nod away, but Boyagoda would have to turn traitor and offer tacit support to the LTTE in Colombo; a bait he steadfastly refused.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">However, Boyagoda did end up embarrassing his government when he joined a hunger fast initiated by fellow prisoners who were fast running out of patience over Colombo's failure to secure their release. Boyagoda was finally freed in 2002 in a prisoner swap, but rehabilitation was not smooth. It took him years to regain his children's confidence, but the harder fight was to convince the establishment that the sinking of the ship was not an error at his end. A court martial finally pronounced him innocent. Boyagoda's lack of acrimony for his captors perhaps reflects a soldier's acceptance of the risks of his job. With a narrative that highlights Boyagoda's ability to surmount the identity politics that scarred Sri Lanka's past, one hopes that the book becomes a metaphor for a new dawn in Sri Lanka where Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim communities will embrace their differences and break out of the islands of exclusion that prevent each from experiencing the other's humanity.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Book: A Long Watch &ndash; War, Captivity and Return in Sri Lanka</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Author: Commodore Ajith Boyagoda as told to Sunila Galappatti</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Publisher: Harper Collins</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rs350</span></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/A-Long-Watch-Hurst-HBK-for-press-Front-web1475914945119.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"a long watch"},{"text":"book review"},{"text":"ajith boyagoda"},{"text":"sunila galappatti"},{"text":"harper collins"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd0990a438e57c3bf1c3bd","status":"Published","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-08T08:22:35.350Z","udate":"2016-10-10T05:22:54.565Z","expirydate":"2017-01-01T08:17:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-08T08:26:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f8accb339bda5d32979369","id":"57f8accb339bda5d32979367","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6270.mp3","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"tagsForSearch":"a long watch,book review,ajith boyagoda,sunila galappatti,harper collins","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Kiran Krishnakumar, a Delhi-based fitness trainer, has shared some tips to make exercising more fun and exciting:</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">* Pump it up with Zumba: A series of repeated aerobic movements, combined with various dance forms, especially Salsa, Mambo and Cha-Cha, forms the main choreographic structure of this fitness routine. The movements basically focus on burning calories for all the duration of the class by involving each and every part of the body and complete muscle movement.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It can even be characterised as a fitness regime that focuses on Cardio fitness and burning excess amount of calories in the body.&nbsp;The combination of dance movements and a groovy musical experience makes the routine effortless to perform and can very well be practised at home without much supervision.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">This method of workout has gained extensive popularity in the past decade and is one of the most sought after workout techniques today, especially because of its light and refreshing approach to fitness!</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">* Regain focus and core strength with martial arts: This method as a workout technique has evolved over time and is not limited to only achieving fitness and health. Any type of martial art is structured around a defence strategy that requires enormous amounts of discipline as well as self-awareness.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">While performing this routine, you will not feel bored or lethargic, since the very spirit of this type of fitness routine, is to energise your mind and body. It allows you to gain control of your thoughts and achieve mental health while achieving physical fitness. However, martial art is a strict discipline and cannot be exercised without careful supervision of a trainer.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">* Bodyweight training with unconventional equipments: Even though you may not find the strength to join a gym and devote your hours to traditional body workout, you can use training methods and equipments from your surroundings to achieve the results of similar workout routines.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bodyweight training uses your body weight as resistance against itself, instead of any gym apparatus, for you to achieve fitness. Some of these exercises include push-ups, squats, sit-ups and pull-ups.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">* Explore power yoga: Power yoga distinguishes from the ancient art of classical yoga, in its approach towards achieving fitness. Devoid of excessive meditation and incantations, power yoga focuses on an intense flow of yogic postures, changing rapidly while aiming to achieve control and endurance in each one, efficiently.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Power yoga has its centre in strengthening the power of mind over body and helping to achieve control of your cognition, while the different postures focus on toning up the muscles of various body parts. This type of routine too, requires careful supervision.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">* Just dance: Be it salsa, that focuses on your abdominal and hip region, or contemporary, that stretches your muscle movements to painful extents, dancing is the most entertaining and fruitful method for achieving fitness and rejuvenation.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/workouts1475915070547.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf57b58d3f458eaf44895","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"martial arts"},{"text":"zumba"},{"text":"boring conventional workouts"},{"text":"power yoga"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Life-Style/2016-08-16/Say-bye-to-boring-conventional-workouts/248671","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-08T08:24:37.645Z","udate":"2016-10-08T08:26:57.978Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-08T08:26:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f8ad454a8d835943bd3376","id":"57f8ad454a8d835943bd3374","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out8456.mp3","tagsForSearch":"martial arts,zumba,boring conventional workouts,power yoga","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57f8ad8df2efff597a396549","title":"Book Review: The Hidden Life Of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate – Discoveries From A Secret World","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb900dea63af2cd0d814cf","content":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">All of us read in school about Jagadish Bose's discovery that plants, like animals, too had \"feelings\", and reacted when \"hurt\". That was back in the early 20th century and must have been a far-fetched idea then. This book by Peter Wohlleben, a German professional \"forester\", shows how far botany has walked along Bose's premise, how scientists are now starting to understand plants as sentient beings who have a \"language\" of communication, can \"taste\" and \"smell\", nurture their young with a kind of tough \"maternal instinct\", have a way of pushing back pesky insects and parasites who feed on them and help each other when in trouble.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The science itself is amazing. At the core of it is research published in 1992 by American forest ecologist Suzanne Simard, who found that primeval forests &ndash; i.e. \"natural\" forests undisturbed by man as opposed to \"plantation\" forests managed for commercial benefit &mdash; have a layer of fungus called mycelium under the top soil, which connects individual trees with each other. This layer forms a kind of dense \"social\" network, that Nature magazine dubbed the \"wood wide web\", which trees use to exchange nutrients and food, to \"support\" those sick or weak and to \"inform\" each other of threats &mdash; behaviour that most of us until now had thought was limited to the animal kingdom.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The science is intriguing, but this is no dry scientific book. On the contrary, it's a moving, beautifully-written evocation of the world of trees, indeed, the world inside a tree, by a man who's studied them closely for many decades. Wohlleben had been a member of Germany's forest commission for two decades and now manages the ancient forests around the Eifel Mountain. His long association with trees, his hard-gathered knowledge of how they work and his ability to communicate it to those who know less, shines through in every paragraph.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Trees aren't inert, unmoving \"objects\" for Wohlleben &mdash; they are persons, with will, emotion and intelligence. Take this passage from a chapter titled Tree School: \"Thirst is harder for trees to endure than hunger, because they can satisfy their hunger whenever they want. Like a baker who always has enough bread, a tree can satisfy a rumbling stomach right away using photosynthesis. But even the best baker cannot bake without water, and the same goes for a tree.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Wohlleben's message is a simple one: humans need to stop meddling with forests. Plantation forests &ndash; rows of trees planted in straight lines with exactly measured distance so that they can be harvested for wood &ndash; are an abomination. Trees and forests have inbuilt mechanisms that help them propagate and grow sustainably, to protect themselves from disease and pests. Since science has a yet imperfect understanding of how these work, it's best that they are left to themselves.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The German original was a huge seller when it came out last year, and the English translation has already gathered great reviews. As Pradip Kishen, India's best known tree expert, writes in his introduction to the Indian edition, Wohlleben's book should be made \"required reading for every forester in the subcontinent\".</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Did you know?</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Fungii are the biggest organisms on earth.

{"_id":"57f8ae06f807295d859fe1eb","title":"Fix your make up mistakes with ease","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e65af76df6bbfd6adf3","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">No matter how focused you are when attempting to line your eyelids with liquid liner, or how perfectly you line our lips before layering on the lipstick, make-up application doesn't always go as planned. However, a few quick fixes can save your time and face.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Experts of beauty brand l'oreal Paris have come up with a list of some common mistakes women make while applying make-up and also how to fix them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>If you over-powdered your face:</strong> If you've applied a little too much powder or foundation, immediately reach for a mist - be it water from a bottle or a spray can. Cup your hands over your eyes as you spray, making sure not to remove or smudge your eye make-up. Once your face is damp, take a tissue and blot away the excess - or you'll end up with a caked face of make-up.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>If your dark lipstick won't come off:</strong> If you opt for a dark shade of lipstick, and later changed your mind, don't panic. Soak a cotton ball in make-up remover or coconut oil and press it over your lips to break up the pigment. If you aren't at home, you can also apply a lighter lipstick, then wipe it off to take off some of the darker pigment as well.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>If you overdrew your eyebrows:</strong> It's perfectly normal to get a little too excited about creating brows that are on point, even if it means you are over-drawing them. Fortunately, you can fix it easily by taking a clean spoolie and dipping it in make-up remover.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Work it through your brows in an upward, shimmying motion. Warm water will also work if you don't have a readily available make-up remover. Also, avoid reaching for an oil while doing this, as it will cause all of the pigments to melt down your face, ruining your perfectly unified skin.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>If you overdrew your cat eye:</strong> Overdrawing a cat eye is one of the most common beauty mistakes women make. As you try to perfect the lines and make each side equal to the other, most of the time, you end up with thick, scary looking top lids.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To reverse this mistake, soak a Q-tip in eye cream instead of make-up remover to erase the extra lines. This will moisturise the eye instead of just drying it out, which will make it easier to reapply any shadow that may come off in the removal process.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>If you applied too much bronzer:</strong> Sometimes in the process of achieving the most natural or sun-kissed look, you tend to go a little too heavy on the bronzer. To fix this issue, take a sponge with some concealer on it and buff out the excess powder. Or, if you would prefer a matte look, grab a fluffy brush and swipe on some translucent powder which will tone down the colour without removing it.</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/makeup1475915262906.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babcefb210157e920b07f9","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"make up application"},{"text":"make up mistakes"},{"text":"eyelids"},{"text":"lipstick"},{"text":"face"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Life-Style/2016-08-16/Fix-your-make-up-mistakes-with-ease-/248824","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-08T08:27:50.590Z","udate":"2016-10-08T08:26:57.978Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-08T08:26:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f8ae06f807295d859fe1ed","id":"57f8ae06f807295d859fe1eb","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out8704.mp3","tagsForSearch":"make up application,make up mistakes,eyelids,lipstick,face","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

The eye must linger over the surface, take in the luminous colours, absorb the subtlety and the details,&rdquo; says the 82-year-old art historian, considered the last word on miniature art in India. He flips through the pages of his much-acclaimed tome on Indian art, The Spirit of Indian Painting (2014, Penguin), to stop at a depiction of the cosmic egg or the golden foetus floating in the dark void, &ldquo;considered the seed of elemental existence&rdquo; in numerous civilisations and cultures. Gazing at the opaque watercolour painted by the Pahari artist Manaku and featured in the Bhagavata Purana, Goswamy notes that the cosmic egg &ldquo;appears a bit dark&rdquo; when laid flat. &ldquo;It is when you hold the painting in your hand, as it was meant to be, and move it ever so lightly, that it reads itself: the great egg begins to glisten, an ovoid form of the purest gold,&rdquo; he says.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">This Manaku work is one of the 101 miniatures featured in his much-acclaimed book, and which he describes as masterpieces painted between 1100 and 1900. At his Chandigarh home, the art historian is carefully studying numerous other works of the 18th century painter for a new publication dedicated to him, to be released in the coming months.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">His 1999 book, Nainsukh of Guler: A Great Indian Painter from a Small Hill-State (Niyogi Books), rescued Nainsukh from oblivion. In his path-breaking essay, &lsquo;Pahari Painting: The family as the basis of style&rsquo;, published in the journal Marg in 1968, he argued that the families of painters shared a common artistic style. The mobility between different centres of patronage meant that the existing system of categorising miniatures according to the courts that commissioned them &mdash; Kangra, Guler, Basohli, Chamba and so on &mdash; was not appropriate. &ldquo;Court styles could vary hugely, depending on who was at work; but families had recognisable techniques and stylistic idiosyncrasies,&rdquo; says Goswamy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">Son of a judge in Sargodha, Goswamy moved to Amritsar after the Partition. His foray into art was rather spontaneous. In 1958, the then IAS officer in Gaya quit the prestigious services to pursue a career in academics and research on the social background of Kangra valley painting. His sole introduction to miniatures was MS Randhawa&rsquo;s book, Kangra Valley Painting, gifted by friends when Goswamy was leaving for his posting. With no dedicated department for art history in India, Goswamy turned to his professor, Hari Ram Gupta, a historian at Panjab University, for guidance. While he did not know much about art, Gupta sent the proposal to the experts: WG Archer, an ex-Indian Civil Service officer who was the keeper of the Indian section at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London; AL Basham, professor at the School of Oriental and African Studies; and historian Karl Khandalavala. Their consent came within weeks, but what pushed Goswamy towards what was to become a life-changing research expedition, was a remark by Archer: &ldquo;I wish we knew some more about the artists&rdquo;.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">In his pursuit, the art historian travelled across the Kangra hills to acquaint himself with the folklore and taught himself the Takri Pahari script. The hunt took him to the pandas or priests of Kurukshetra, Haridwar and Varanasi, who keep genealogical records of all visitors in their bahi or registers. Goswamy had memories of going to Haridwar as a child, and signing his own name in one of them. &ldquo;I had written my name in English and had misspelled it,&rdquo; says Goswamy, adding, &ldquo;But that got me thinking that Pahari painters may well have once been pilgrims. Pahaad mein kehte hain ki aap jeeteji Haridwar na gaye, toh mar ke aap zaroor jaayenge. (In the mountains, they say, if you didn&rsquo;t go to Haridwar when you were alive, you&rsquo;ve got to go there once you&rsquo;re dead).&rdquo; A picture of Nainsukh escorting the ashes of Raja Balwant Singh to Haridwar furthered his resolve and Goswamy leafed through the handwritten records in search of a family tree. He also studied land settlement records compiled by the colonial state, for it was common for artists to be paid through allotments. Goswamy painstakingly reconstructed the family lineages and styles.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">Consequently, the course of the study of Indian miniatures world over was altered. Having founded the department of art history at Panjab University in 1963, he has been a visiting professor at universities the world over, including at Heidelberg, Pennsylvania, California, Texas and Zurich. &ldquo;No one knows more about Indian painting than BN Goswamy,&rdquo; says Glenn Lowry, American art historian and director of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City. Not too far from his neighbourhood in the Big Apple, in September 2011, Goswamy had installed what is considered to be one of the most spectacular exhibitions of Indian art, &lsquo;Wonder of the Age: Master Painters of India, 1100&ndash;1900&rsquo;, at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">Goswamy has meticulously differentiated between paintings produced in the family workshops of the Rajput and Pahari courts, where the artists worked at home and everyone lent a hand, and that of the Mughal ateliers, where artists from across the empire were deployed under the strict discipline of a master ustad. Author of over 25 books, he is known for the intricacies with which he reads each work &mdash; the techniques, narratives and composition &mdash; and yet leaves room for imagination. In a note on an arresting image of the Mughal emperor Akbar, he writes, &ldquo;Was this portrait commissioned? Did the emperor sit for it, if he truly sat for any portrait of his at all? It is most unlikely &hellip; Almost certainly, the painter of this affecting portrait must have seen the emperor several times, but here he is recollecting, not constructing an image.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">Goswamy laces his writings with legends. One such tale is of a painter commissioned by his patron, an emperor, to paint the queen. Since the queen was in purdah, the painter imagined her as a beauty with perfect features, but just as he was finishing, a drop of black paint fell onto the rani&rsquo;s thigh, on the exact spot where she had a mole. When the emperor saw it, he accused the painter of a liaison with the queen and imprisoned him. Later, a goddess appeared before the emperor to explain it was she who had made that drop of paint fall to make the portrait more real. The emperor freed the painter and bestowed several gifts on him. &ldquo;These are stories being told by the inheritors of old traditions and should not be dismissed,&rdquo; says Goswamy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">Over the years, he has become one such storyteller, with the prudence to distinguish fact from fiction.</span></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/Geet-Govind-Dr-B-N-Goswami1475915412423.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"bn goswamy"},{"text":"indian art critic"},{"text":"sarabhai foundation"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd0990a438e57c3bf1c3bd","status":"Published","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-08T08:30:20.516Z","udate":"2016-10-10T05:23:07.628Z","expirydate":"2017-01-01T08:27:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-08T08:26:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f8ae9cf2efff597a39655b","id":"57f8ae9cf2efff597a396559","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out4209.mp3","tagsForSearch":"bn goswamy,indian art critic,sarabhai foundation","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

So what made you delve into her life in Asha Bhosle: a Musical Biography (Hay House, Rs 599)?</span></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">I&rsquo;m a Lata Mangeshkar acolyte, yes. Which is why it&rsquo;s taken me so long to write Asha&rsquo;s biography. I finished my Lata biography in 1995 and this one in August, 2016. In between, I wrote Naushadnama, composer Naushad&rsquo;s biography. It is not that I do not admire Asha. I admire her for the sheer courage and guts with which she faced extremely trying circumstances. She never gave up and gradually found her own footing. That admiration was reason enough to pen a biography of this wonderful singer.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">You were a part of the music industry in the 1950s and 1960s in what&rsquo;s referred to as its golden era. You were sitting in on recording sessions, spending time with composers and singers, eavesdropping on conversations. What was Asha Bhosle&rsquo;s world like? How did she become a phenomenon?</span></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">Let&rsquo;s be frank. Asha Bhosle was no phenomenon to begin with. She was a struggler. I saw her as a struggler. That&rsquo;s why in the book I began with how she struggled to find good work. If producers were not using Lata, they would say use Geeta Dutt or Shamshad Begum. Asha didn&rsquo;t even feature in the list. So she sang what she got. In fact, she sang more than any other singer, including Mohammad Rafi, who was absolutely prolific. Her Marathi-Hindi diction was a problem, she didn&rsquo;t work on her Urdu like Lata did. She had a rough marriage.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">This was until OP Nayyar, a tyrant, took her under his wing. Because Nayyar had a score to settle with Lata, he decided on using her sister&rsquo;s voice for his compositions. Nayyar spotted the fact that Asha was strong in the low notes. He was a Punjabi from Lahore, whose grip on Urdu was really strong. The breakthrough came with Naya Daur. Maang ke saath tumhara and Ude jab jab zulfein became big hits.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">She found success and was some kind of competition to Lata. When Lata had a falling out with SD (Burman), he used Asha in Nau Do Gyarah. For the five years that SD didn&rsquo;t work with Lata, Asha benefitted. The phenomenon, as we know it, is probably RD&rsquo;s (Burman&rsquo;s) creation. To me, Asha emerged as a brilliant singer with OP Nayyar and SD and RD. Mera kuch samaan tumhare paas pada hai for RD and Gulzar in Ijaazat is one of her finest renditions, something she delivered, perhaps, better than Lata. But no, she was never a phenomenon. Lata never let anyone get there.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">The first 50 pages of your book are on the rivalry between the two Mangeshkar sisters.</span></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">I had to take note of the fact that there was some ruthlessness in the relationship between the two sisters.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">Lata and Asha grew up in the same house, just three years apart, and were competitive even as kids. When Lata found attention and popularity, displacing every female singer in the music industry, Asha wanted to do the same. In the 1950s and &rsquo;60s, Lata charged Rs 500 for a song, unheard of in the industry, while Asha had to settle for Rs 100-150. While Lata chose what to sing or whom to sing for, Asha did not have that luxury. It rankled. If Asha performed live, Lata never attended her shows &mdash; something that would infuriate Asha. The lack of encouragement and musical support from an older sister turned matters worse. Asha took it upon herself to prove herself.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">But Lata never let go of the top position. The only songs she wasn&rsquo;t singing were performed by Geeta (Dutt). Until Geeta began having problems with Guru Dutt, there was no real opening for Asha. She also drew close to Pancham (RD Burman), who had come up with a new style of his own. But even he gave some of the more nuanced numbers to Lata. Asha never liked that and complained often. She even refused to sing the fast numbers, saying that she could sing what her sister could. But RD refused to compose the cabarets if Asha wouldn&rsquo;t sing them and she relented.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">Through several years, Lata sang for the &ldquo;pure&rdquo; Indian woman on screen, while Asha was the voice of the vamp. Did the emergence of the independent, modern woman have to do with Asha finding work in the 1970s?</span></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">Absolutely. Lata was brilliant but she was the voice of the meek heroine in white. Even the romance of those days needed the heroine to be coy. Lata&rsquo;s vocal image was perfect for that. As films began reflecting a changing India, composers like RD Burman began to capitalise on that. The cabaret song was a free woman&rsquo;s song, the one who was no more confined to the four walls of the house and Asha sang that with much aplomb. To the generation of the 1970s and 1980s, Asha was a superior singer, even more versatile. The heroine she sang for was expressive and spoke her mind. Her duets with Kishore Kumar broke the mould too.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">You did not approach Asha Bhosle for the book, even though you and your wife have known her and the Mangeshkars really well.</span></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">It was a conscious decision to not approach Asha for the book. I did think about speaking to her a couple of times, but then decided against it. I knew the moment I would approach her, I could get into trouble. If it was just about dealing with Asha, I could&rsquo;ve just rung her up, but today you have to deal with the whole family and legal battles can ensue. So I wanted her to see the book only when it came out.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">What do you plan to work on now?</span></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">A book on Indian cricket.</span></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/lata-raju-bharatan-asha_4801475915674100.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"asha bhonsle"},{"text":"lata mangeshkar"},{"text":"biography"},{"text":"music biography"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd0990a438e57c3bf1c3bd","status":"Published","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-08T08:34:42.132Z","udate":"2016-10-10T05:23:28.967Z","expirydate":"2017-01-01T08:33:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-08T08:26:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f8afa2f2efff597a396564","id":"57f8afa2f2efff597a396562","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"tagsForSearch":"asha bhonsle,lata mangeshkar,biography,music biography","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

It creates the infrastructure of ideas according to which we interpret the world. Like the limitations of our senses we seldom question the limitations of our historical view, which we take as a given fact, even though it changes with every generation. Each society creates an idea of history through which it interprets civilization in its own image.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> In the modern age science, technology and rational materialism have created an historical view that makes ancient Greece, in which the seeds of modern culture arose, the basis of civilization as a whole. It looks to the precursors of civilization in the ancient Near East, Sumeria and Egypt, from which the Greeks derived the rudiments of their culture.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">This view ignores or denigrates other ancient traditions like those of India, China or Mesoamerica as of little importance. Indeed if we examine books on world history today we discover that they are largely histories of modern Europe, with non-European cultures turned into a mere footnote, or simply dismissed as primitive, that is not technologically advanced, however spiritually or artistically evolved they may have been.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> In the post-colonial era, however, we are now questioning this Euro centric and materialistic view of humanity. We are recognizing the value of traditional cultures and indigenous peoples, whose mistreatment and devaluation now appears on par with the destruction of our natural environment that we have been hastily promoting in the name of material progress.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">With a new understanding of depth psychology, mythology and comparative religion we are gaining a greater appreciation of spiritual ways of life, like the science of yoga, which developed outside of both the European and Middle Eastern cultural matrixes. A number of racial, ethnic and religious groups have challenged their negative portrayal in modern Euro centric historical accounts.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> For example, the European conquest of America, which was previously regarded as the benign expansion of advanced European civilization, is now being reinterpreted as a genocide of native peoples and destruction of their ancient cultures.

{"_id":"57f8b3e3b38e1d5d6a0c3556","title":"A Bridge Too Far","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb900dea63af2cd0d814cf","content":"<p style=\"margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">On this September day, over seven decades ago, a most audacious Allied operation, intended to wrap up the Second World War by 1944 itself, ended ignominiously with shattered remnants of their elite forces withdrawing or marching into captivity. With its ambitious, over-optimistic planning but sheer bravery on the ground, Operation Market Garden is possibly one of the war's best-known episodes, mainly due to a big budget, multi-star Hollywood film, whose most incongruous bits are the truest, and an episode of a popular American TV series. Both owe their origin to books.<br /> <br /> The operation aimed at capitalising the German forces' disorganised retreat through western Europe in August-September 1944 to liberate Holland and secure a launching pad to invade Germany. Paratroopers would seize bridges on/near the Dutch-German border (\"Market\"), and ground forces link up with them (\"Garden\").<br /> <br /> But as its most famous account (and film) is named, it proved to be \"</span><a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/A-Bridge-Too-Far\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;\">A Bridge Too Far</span></a><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">\", or rather \"bridges too far\", despite the valour of the American 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, the British 1st Airborne Division and their glider and transport aircraft pilots. It was rather the hubris of the commanders and the planners that doomed the mission, in which everything which could go wrong did so unerringly.<br /> <br /> How this happened is told in the first overall account -- Irish journalist<span class=\"apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></span><a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Cornelius-Ryan\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;\">Cornelius Ryan</span></a><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">'s \"The Bridge Too Far\" (1974).<br /> <br /> Ryan, who achieved fame with his multi-perspective account of the Normandy landings in \"The Longest Day\" (1956), did the same for \"Market Garden\" in his last book. Taking seven years to research and write, it was published a few months before he lost his own battle to cancer.<br /> <br /> Still the definitive work with American, British, Polish, Dutch and German viewpoints in it, Ryan, for the first time, also revealed less than complimentary views of former US President and Allied Supreme Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower on his temperamental subordinate, British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, as well as those of Prince Bernhard of The Netherlands.<br /> <br /> The 1977 film version, directed by Richard Attenborough (who agreed to fund his own dream project \"Gandhi\"), mostly remained true to the book, from where some of its most famous dialogues are taken verbatim as well as dramatic events -- a US soldier forcing a surgeon at gunpoint to check his apparently dead officer, for one.<br /> <br /> However, using one statement out of context -- as an unforgettable ending line, it painted the speaker, British First Airborne Corps commander Lt. Gen. Frederick 'Boy' Browning (husband of author Daphne Du Maurier) as a villain, or at least unconscionable. (He did make the remark, but at a conference before the operation.)<br /> <br /> Browning was, however, guilty of neglecting information that strong German forces were near Arnhem and sending the officer concerned on medical leave (Brian Urquhart, then a major, subsequently went on to a glittering career in the UN, especially in Congo, where he convinced rebels to release him by warning Gurkha soldiers -- whom they feared -- would come after them if he was harmed).<br /> <br /> Arnhem, the furthest objective with the \"bridge that turned out to be too far\", has seen most leading British participants share their experiences. Prominent among these are the Division Commander, Maj. Gen. R.E. Urquhart (played by Sean Connery) in his frank but wry \"Arnhem\" (1958), or \"A Drop Too Many\" (1980) by then Lt. Col. John Frost, who reached the bridge with his 2nd battalion, was cut off but held on for four desperate days against superior forces.<br /> <br /> Besides his account of the battle and as POW, Frost also recounts his experience of serving as an consultant to the film, his views of the actor playing him (Anthony Hopkins) and what he particularly disliked about the depiction of his exploits. He also tells us that he later found that his then German opponent, Heinz Harmel of the SS, also thought the same.<br /> <br /> Then, there are British historian Middle Middlebrook's \"Arnhem 1944: The Airborne Battle\" (1994), commissioned for the battle's 50th anniversary, Chris Brown's \"Arnhem: Nine Days of Battle\", and ex-SAS director and the Attenborough film's consultant, Col John Waddy's \"A Tour of the Arnhem Battlefields\" (1999).</span></span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\"><br /> Robert Kershaw's \"It Never Snows in September: The German View of Market-Garden and the Battle of Arnhem, September 1944\" (2007) gives a perspective from the other side.<br /> <br /> Meanwhile, paratroopers of 101st Airborne can be seen in action in the fourth episode of Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks's 10-episode \"</span><a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Band-of-Brothers\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;\">Band of Brothers</span></a><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">\" (telecast 2001), based on American historian Stephen Ambrose's 1992 book of the same name.</span></span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">On the other hand, one entry in Miles Noonan's collection of military anecdotes is telling.

Jyotisha (Astrology) is a vedanga consisting of Ganita (Mathematical) and Phalita (Predictive) branches. As per modern scientific theory, the Universe came into existence following a huge explosion about 15 billion years ago. From this explosion, Galaxies, Stars, Planets etc., of the universe formed. Life came into existence on Earth about 4.5 billion years ago. In the solar system. Sun is at the centre and all planets including Asteroids, Meteorites, Meteoroids etc. revolve around it. Sun is a self luminous, body of the solar system and Earth is its third planet. As of now this planet only has life.

{"_id":"57f8b64d4a8d835943bd33bf","title":"Crime Patrol: Book Review of Chain of Custody","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb900dea63af2cd0d814cf","content":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>The first time we meet Inspector Borei Gowda, the protagonist of Anita Nair&rsquo;s crime novels, he has a hangover. His son is in a capitation fee medical college, his wife has taken a transfer to be with the boy, and Gowda stays alone in Bangalore, heating up rasam rice for dinner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">From his family home in the old south Bangalore suburb of Jayanagar, with its support system of Suma coffee powder and trusted condiment shops, Gowda has moved to an emerging development in the north. He rides a Bullet and has a tattoo. Stuck in a double cul de sac of age and career, he is posted at a police station on the city outskirts. In summer, the adjoining lake bed dries up, and a constable must burn eucalyptus leaves to drive away the swarms of mosquitoes that descend on the station every evening, even as the head constable mutters darkly about dengue. But after the rains, when the lake fills with water, Gowda sits under a tree to gaze at the lilies and migratory birds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">He needs these moments of quiet &mdash; Bangalore is no longer the small placid town in which he grew up. It has grown rapidly, in multiple concentric circles; but unplanned growth has also brought a rise in crime and corruption. If the familiar locations in the novel &mdash; Nilgiris, Pecos &mdash; bring a smile of recognition, there is also another part of the cityscape that is constantly being torn down and rebuilt. Along the city margins, in restaurants with generic names and dim lighting, middle-aged men get drunk and discuss real estate and women. Much of Gowda&rsquo;s work takes him into these urban peripheries, often literally.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">At the end of the first book, Gowda is back in a relationship with his college girlfriend. But little else has changed in his life, except that he now texts apologetic messages to both lover and wife. It is only work that energises him. Even if most days are spent drifting through &ldquo;pending files, briefings, bickering, paperwork, phone calls&rdquo;, he lives for the moments, albeit few, when he can set something right.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">In the second novel, Gowda solves a murder case and breaks one link in a long chain of child trafficking. But, as often happens in crime fiction, the murder is not the real story; the real story is how the investigator&rsquo;s character is constructed. What keeps him going as he stares into the abyss? Is it the wide-eyed children, too afraid to speak or the young trafficker, himself sold by his father at the age of six? Or, is it the unending chain of violence perpetuated by those who were once victims themselves?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">As he works on the physically and emotionally exhausting case, Gowda searches for his own sense of personal identity. A middle-class Indian father, he struggles to communicate with his son, just as his father still struggles to communicate with him. Gowda&rsquo;s brother tells him their father talks to the coconut trees he planted for his children. &ldquo;Most days he talks to the tree that is supposed to be you. He misses you, Borei.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Reflecting on his personal failures, Gowda decides to go back to the station: &ldquo;That was the one place where he knew who he really was.&rdquo; For, despite everything else in his life, he is something of a legend in the city&rsquo;s police force: blunt, fearless, and with a sakaath sense of right and wrong.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Nevertheless, it is not easy work. The needs are great, the resources limited, and it is easy to feel defeated. As one member of Gowda&rsquo;s team remarks: &ldquo;It feels like we are at the visible end of the garbage dump.

Written between 2008 and 2013, years which saw the restoration of democracy in Pakistan after General Pervez Musharraf&rsquo;s dystopian regime, to the first-ever constitutional transfer of power to a civilian government in 2013, the essays map the highs and lows of the journey.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">In the earlier essays, a triumph of hope is evident. In an experiment with the use of cellphones in rural Punjab, Rumi discerns a provincial government &ldquo;whose leadership is responsive to the citizens&rsquo; concerns&rdquo;. He&nbsp;finds the current Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif &ldquo;a changed man&rdquo;. For Pakistan&rsquo;s television stations &mdash; &ldquo;powerful agent of change at a time when we had almost given up hope&rdquo; &mdash; he predicts &ldquo;a glorious future&rdquo;.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">Following the 26/11 attacks, thus, Rumi counsels restraint: an Indian military response, he argues, would undermine Pakistan&rsquo;s fragile democratic renaissance, in the long term, damaging any hope of a durable peace.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">In New Delhi, this argument carried considerable weight: democracy, it was argued, was the best hope of bringing about the kinds of structural transformations that would facilitate India-Pakistan peace. Early in 2013, Rumi wrote that &ldquo;the unprecedented consensus on peace is acknowledged by the neighbour but not fully&nbsp;appreciated for its historic nature&rdquo;.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">That turnaround, Rumi ruefully acknowledges in a post-script, was less historic than he believed. Since 2014,&nbsp;he writes, Pakistan has seen &ldquo;a virtual coup &mdash; a post-modern version &mdash; where the military is back in the driving&nbsp;seat. Media freedoms, he points out, have been curtailed; terrorists targeting Afghanistan and India still operate freely. Poignantly, Rumi himself was forced to leave the country in 2014, after surviving an assassination attempt.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">Less optimistic observers might have asked why President Asif Ali Zardari, who came to office promising to transform the relationship, proved unable to push his recalcitrant generals forward on the<span class=\"apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></span><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/kashmir/\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;\">Kashmir</span></a><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">&nbsp;compromise General Musharraf had envisioned, but could not deliver on. Sharif fared no better.</span></span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">There are, sadly, deep reasons for democracy not striking roots in Pakistan. First, and perhaps most important, the military&rsquo;s praetorian role has choked the organic growth and transformative possibilities of politics. There&nbsp;is no Pakistani Mayawati or Nitish Kumar, speaking for new aspirations; indeed, as the work of the scholar Ayesha Siddiqa underscores, violent Islamists have acquired legitimacy as anti-establishment utopians.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">Secondly, there is no politically significant national bourgeois, nor indeed large capital, pressing for change. Traditional traders, and the chauvinist culture they emerge from, enjoy disproportionate political influence in&nbsp;India; in Pakistan, the influence of modernising new &eacute;lites is negligible.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">Finally, there is the question of culture. Liberalism is not, as Indians confronting Hindutva and other forms of chauvinist identity politics are painfully discovering, a self-evident virtue. In India, liberalism might yet&nbsp;survive because majoritarian communalism can provide no solutions to the problems of a rapidly-modernising, heterogeneous society for which tradition can no longer provide solutions. In Pakistan, though, communal majoritarianism has won a decisive triumph.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">Like many liberals in Pakistan, Rumi seeks to salvage from a national project some elements for hope: it is, as one of Candide&rsquo;s characters observes, &ldquo;the only way of making life bearable&rdquo;. The lesson from this collection of essays, though, is that hope offers neither a way forward, nor even insight.</span></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/raza-rumi-7591475917604758.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"fractious path"},{"text":"razaq rumi"},{"text":"harper collins"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"News","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd0990a438e57c3bf1c3bd","status":"Published","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-08T09:06:52.942Z","udate":"2016-10-10T05:24:25.572Z","expirydate":"2016-12-31T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-08T09:17:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f8b72cf6280d58e8c2bdd1","id":"57f8b72cf6280d58e8c2bdcf","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out7366.mp3","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"tagsForSearch":"fractious path,razaq rumi,harper collins","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57f8b827b38e1d5d6a0c3587","title":"Thumri: The feminine voice in Hindustani classical music","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb900dea63af2cd0d814cf","content":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">At first glance itself, Vidya Rao seems a perfect match for the grace and femininity of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/thumri-festival-brings-back-the-songs-from-the-courts-of-nawabs/story-4x8QwX8AziqIaJo7LG1yRL.html\">thumri</a>, one of the most beautiful genres of Hindustani classical music. Wrapped in a handloom sari, she radiates an old-world delicacy and speaks so softly, you have to sometimes strain to hear her. This Monday, Rao will sing in memory of her guru, the remarkable Naina Devi, from whom she learnt thumri for eight years. The concert will be one more landmark in a lifelong love affair with thumri. Rao says she was seduced by its charms from the time she was a little girl and would tag along with her mother for music concerts in Hyderabad.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Growing up, she learned both Bharata Natyam and Hindustani classical music. But not&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/thumri-style-monsoon/story-m6P5I9OUGu19R6Q8VXEPZN.html\">thumri&nbsp;</a>because it wasn&rsquo;t considered entirely respectable. That would have to wait. After graduating from Madras University, she came to Delhi for an MA in Sociology at the Delhi School of Economics &ndash; but also because she had heard of a great music teacher there, B N Datta. &ldquo;He had a small house in Karol Bagh,&rdquo; she recalls. &ldquo;And as I was climbing up the stairs to meet him, I could hear him teaching and I immediately knew he was extraordinary.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">But she still did not get a chance to learn thumri. B N Datta taught her khayal instead. &ldquo;By that time I think I was brainwashed into believing that it was too difficult to master, that maybe I just wasn&rsquo;t good enough for it,&rdquo; she says with a laugh. And also, that old question: was it quite respectable? She would have to wait a few more years before she got the chance to realize her childhood dream. In those years, she got married, left the city, and when the marriage didn&rsquo;t work out, picked up her tanpura and little daughter and came back to Delhi, to her guruji. (Incidentally, the daughter has grown up to become one of Bollywood&rsquo;s most promising actresses, Aditi Rao Hydari).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">After B N Datta passed away, Rao went to Naina Devi, under whom she finally learned thumri and its allied forms &ndash; kajri, chaiti, hori, barahmasa. A few years ago, she wrote Heart To Heart Remembering Naina Devi, recounting the life of one of the most exceptional classical singers of our time. Born in a prominent Bengali Brahmo family (her grandfather was Keshub Chandra Sen), Naina Devi was encouraged to learn music from early on. But when she married into the Kapurthala royal family, her music went silent. It was only after her husband&rsquo;s death that Naina Devi moved to Delhi and blossomed into an arts patron, administrator, singer and teacher par excellence. Rao remembers the open house Naina Devi kept in Delhi&rsquo;s Kaka Nagar where legendary singers and musicians would drift in and out, from sitar maestro Vilayat Khan to the great table player Samta Prasad.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">The singer rehearses for her upcoming recital. (Saumya Khandelwal/HT PHOTO)</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Purab ka gaana</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Thumri is rooted in the world of women in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The form in which it is recognised today evolved as a court art in late 18th and early 19th century Awadh, where it was sung by courtesans who performed for royalty and nobility, both in the kotha or the durbar. They drew from the musical repertoire of desi gana, that is, songs of the soil, music of the household. Chaiti, kajri, hori, barahmasa were songs sung by women in their homes. The narrative voice of the thumri has always been female.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Despite that, Rao points out, professional singers gained legitimacy only if they got taalim from men. She narrates an incident &ndash; once, Gauhar Jaan, the legendary tawaif of Banaras, and a celebrated beauty, wanted to learn music from a particular ustad. She kept trying to meet him without any success. Finally she asked someone to speak to him on her behalf. The ustad &ndash; who was short, overweight with small pox marks on his face &ndash; told the messenger contemptuously, &lsquo;First tell her to pay 100 rupees just for the honour of seeing my face. Gaana toh baad ki baat hai.&rsquo; Rao laughs and says that the story was narrated to her with great approval. &ldquo;With an ustad, they were seen as artistes,&rdquo; says Rao. &ldquo;Without them, they were mere entertainers.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Till today, thumri is described as &lsquo;light classical music,&rsquo; somehow diminishing its importance in the overall scheme of Hindustani classical music. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s associated with women &ndash; and also because of its seductive nature,&rdquo; says Rao. Thumri is all about emotion. If you don&rsquo;t have the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/thumri-festival-of-bhaav-bandish-and-much-more/story-2M6qlo6VVQ483t6HIxoMrM.html\">bhaav</a>, you don&rsquo;t have the music. The themes revolve around love and its overwhelming emotions &ndash; the longing and teasing, the pain and anger. &ldquo;But it is seldom one-tone,&rdquo; says Rao. &ldquo;It is a complex layering of emotion. Suppose a woman is angry with her lover for being out all night. She is upset, she is angry. But remember, the tawaif was singing in court &ndash; it couldn&rsquo;t be all sad. It would still have to have a little shokhi. Her bhaav might have been like this -- I&rsquo;m going to close the door on you because I&rsquo;m angry. But I&rsquo;m leaving it slightly ajar because maybe you want to repent and come in and make up with me?&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rao believes her training in dance helped her understand the bhaav that is at the heart of thumri. &ldquo;Though it also requires you to study music, to understand literature and history. You can&rsquo;t take a logical approach to thumri,&rdquo; she says.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">This is not to deny the finesse of the technique. The hallmark of thumri is the repetition of a particular bol &ndash; say, Mose na bolo, something a khandita nayika (the angry, betrayed heroine) would say. The singer cannot sing the same bol the same way every time. There is an artistry involved.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">&ldquo;Thumri expands our emotional universe, makes us deeply human,&rdquo; says Rao. She is reluctant to say whether a woman would need to have &ldquo;lived a life&rdquo; to do justice to the genre. But she does say, &ldquo;I think you need to be vulnerable, which is not the same as being weak. You should be willing to experience life.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rao recalls that Naina Devi would say that &ldquo;thumri ke liye tabiyat chahiye&rdquo; -- and also despair that many thumri singers had sanitised the form so much that they sounded as if they were singing bhajans!</span></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/vidya-rao_433a1d2e-8178-11e6-a0d9-e435f3f63e151475917855505.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"vidya rao"},{"text":"vocalist"},{"text":"naina devi"},{"text":"music"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd0990a438e57c3bf1c3bd","status":"Published","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-08T09:11:03.332Z","udate":"2016-10-10T05:24:32.365Z","expirydate":"2016-12-31T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-08T09:17:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f8b827b38e1d5d6a0c3589","id":"57f8b827b38e1d5d6a0c3587","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out7601.mp3","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"tagsForSearch":"vidya rao,vocalist,naina devi,music","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57f8b8c3b38e1d5d6a0c35a4","title":"Writing a new play?  The Shankar Shesh Foundation can help you produce it","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb900dea63af2cd0d814cf","content":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">As a teenager, Sanjay Shesh (now 54) often accompanied his playwright father Dr Shankar Shesh to Hindi and Marathi dramas. He didn&rsquo;t want to write plays, or even act in them. But he liked accompanying his father. Their family moved from Bilaspur (Chhattisgarh) to Mumbai in the &rsquo;70s because Shesh, inspired by theatre director Satyadev Dubey, wanted to devote his life to theatre. From 1969 to 1981, the author penned 22 Hindi plays, including some popular ones such as Ek Aur Dronacharya, Poster and Bin Baati Ke Deep. Now, 35 years after his father passed away, Sanjay is launching a literary initiative &mdash; the Shankar Shesh Foundation &mdash; to honour Shesh&rsquo;s work. Two plays, Komal Gandhar and Raktbeej, will be performed at the NCPA on October 2, which is Dr Shesh&rsquo;s birthday. We talk to Sanjay about the enterprise as he reminisces about his father&rsquo;s career, and what inspired him to write.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>How has your father&rsquo;s involvement in theatre influenced your family?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">My father pursued the arts all his life. All his sons pursued engineering. We were exposed to theatre because it was written at our house, and we had people of [literary] repute visiting us. So, while theatre wasn&rsquo;t our primary interest, we were introduced to art and culture at home. I wouldn&rsquo;t say we were keen theatregoers, but we weren&rsquo;t averse to it as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><em><strong>The late Hindi playwright Shankar Shesh.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>What led you to launch the foundation now?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Our father hasn&rsquo;t been with us since 1981. But my mother, Sudha Shesh, was there. She would give permission to those who approached her to stage his plays. But things were not organised. Like my father, she was always willing to let people perform his works. We never thought about royalties. Even today, we don&rsquo;t think about it. When my mother came to live with us in Mumbai, a group took her consent to perform one of my father&rsquo;s plays in July 2015. I accidentally happened to watch that play in Marathi. I was so impressed and enjoyed it so much that I felt I should do something about his plays. Unfortunately, we lost our mother soon after that. When she passed away, I thought I should do something for both of them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>What is the societal and political context of your father&rsquo;s plays? What real experiences inspired him to write them?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">He was associated with education. While working as a Hindi professor in Nagpur, he wrote Ek Aur Dronacharya, which has been performed more than 100 times. He wrote plays that spoke about the political environment of education in India. After his stint with education, he became part of tribal welfare. There, he was introduced to casteism in India, which inspired him to he come up with stories like Bad Ka Pani and Poster, which was based on Bastar (a tribal area in Chhattisgarh). He travelled a lot in Bastar.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Shankar Shesh at work.</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>He also wrote scripts for movies&hellip;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">After he moved to Mumbai, he wrote the story of Gharaonda (1977). He realised that you have to struggle in the city to have a house of your own. The film is about that. Then, when he saw that many of his friends were getting divorced, he wrote Dooriyan (1979). He also wrote the dialogues for Sridevi&rsquo;s first movie &mdash; Solva Sawan (1979). It also featured Amol Palekar.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Do you feel Shankar Shesh&rsquo;s work hasn&rsquo;t received enough recognition?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">My father wrote plays prior to 1981. He was writing Hindi plays in a city where art and culture that was predominantly Maharashtrian. The people working with Hindi theatre were living in Delhi and Lucknow, and they thought that since Dr Shesh was living in Mumbai, he was writing for films. So, I think I should get him the recognition, which I don&rsquo;t think he received [in his lifetime].</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Shankar Shesh receives his PhD degree from Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit .</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>What do you hope to achieve with the foundation?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">The idea is to create an institution around his work. If a youngster wants to write, he or she can use this platform, and write a play for the Shankar Shesh Foundation. Today, it&rsquo;s difficult to find someone who has a good idea, a good script, and also good dialogue-writing skills. For example, we want to get 10 people &mdash; one person with the idea, another to write the script, and a third to write dialogues, and so on. Together, we would create new scripts, plays, stories and poems. The idea is to encourage new writers. We may also contemporise my father&rsquo;s literature.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>How can a writer apply to write to your foundation?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">We&rsquo;ll invite playwrights to write in various languages. We&rsquo;ll put together a jury. I&rsquo;m the managing trustee.

{"_id":"57f8b9e5b547d25d4f55bb1d","title":"How social media is reviving book clubs","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb900dea63af2cd0d814cf","content":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">In July, Sharin Bhatti (33), an entrepreneur, went to the Mockingbird Caf&eacute; and Bar, Churchgate, for a Broke Bibliophile (BB) offline meeting. A Facebook group with over 900 members, BB is a virtual platform where members can discover deals for book purchases on e-commerce websites such as Flipkart and Amazon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">&ldquo;There were 20 to 25 people aged 18 to 25. We were asked to introduce ourselves, and speak about the books we&rsquo;ve read, or are reading, and why we picked them. It was like a speed dating session, but about books,&rdquo; says Bhatti.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>From one of Broke Bibliophile&rsquo;s previous meetings in Mumbai. (Photo: Vidya Subramanian/HT)</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">While others discussed Murakami and Salman Rushdie, Bhatti chose to speak about The Black Tower, a crime fiction novel by British author PD James. &ldquo;The genre is thrilling and allows for easy conversation. It&rsquo;s like an ice-breaker,&rdquo; she says.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Turns out her choice of book was perfect &ndash; there were people who hadn&rsquo;t heard of James or her works. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the whole point of book clubs, isn&rsquo;t it? You meet new people, discover new authors, expand your reading circle,&rdquo; says Bhatti.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">This has been truer than ever over the last few months. Reading is no longer an isolated act. Through online and offline platforms, book lovers are connecting with fellow literature enthusiasts to make reading a social activity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Log off</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Sure, book clubs are hardly a new concept. Traditionally, members read a pre-decided book, and gathered around to discuss the writing, themes, characterisation, and takeaways.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Even today, the fundamental purpose of these book clubs remains the same.&thinsp;What has changed, however, is the method of networking, thanks to social media. For instance, originally, BB functioned as a Facebook-only group. In April this year, they first went offline with a multi-city meet-up (Delhi, Chennai and Mumbai).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>The Reading social is an experiment to get Mumbaikars to read as often as possible. (Photo courtesy: The Reading Social )</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">&ldquo;The decision to meet in person was taken through a spontaneous online discussion. A few of us took the initiative to make it happen. Eleven people showed up at the first event in Mumbai. Now, we see 20 to 25 people,&rdquo; says Nirav Mehta, host, BB Mumbai Chapter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">BB&rsquo;s transition was only the beginning. Books on Toast (BoT) , which started as a city-based book donation drive in 2011, too, converted to a club. Previously it was a Facebook page that notified members about a location in Mumbai they could visit to donate books.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">It was during these sporadic meetings that an idea was born. &ldquo;Every time people came together to give away books, they would always hang back and discuss the ones they were giving away. That&rsquo;s when we realised the dearth of a dedicated platform for enthusiasts to come together,&rdquo; says Bhatti.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>The Reading Social is a series of events where people get together to sit and get some quiet reading done. (Photo courtesy: The Reading Social)</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Yet these clubs retain an online presence. This helps them reach a younger audience. BB&rsquo;s core demographic varies between the age group of 18 to 27, and sees students and young professionals. &ldquo;We get all kinds of people &ndash; even those who&rsquo;ve read just one or two books in their lives and are looking for avenues to expand their reading,&rdquo; says Mehta.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Evolution is key</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Keeping in mind the young audience, the clubs have evolved over time. None of them stick to the one-book policy. As a result, members have access to more books, and conversations are freewheeling. You&rsquo;re free to obsessively praise your favourite author, recall which book changed your life, even bring up the dreaded Chetan Bhagat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">This freedom to choose any book, in turn, has these meetings doubling up as book swap platforms. This is a huge draw for bibliophiles whose salaries can&rsquo;t keep up with their reading habit, or who don&rsquo;t have the space in cramped Mumbai apartments.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Broke Bibliophile&rsquo;s core demographic varies between the age group of 18 to 27, and sees students and young professionals. (Photo: Vidya Subramanian/HT )</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Moreover, meetings are often thematic &ndash; from popular series like Harry Potter to serious themes like Holocaust literature. BYOB (Bring Your Own Book) Bombay, for instance, always has a theme - books written by female authors and Indian authors, among others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">The biggest draw, however, remains the collective motivation to read as often as possible - an increasingly difficult pursuit in the age we live in. As an experiment in this direction, 28-year-old Sandeep Malhotra co-founded The Reading Social - a series of events where people get together to sit and get some quiet reading done.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">The first edition, held last month at AntiSocial (Khar), saw 18 people with books and reading devices. It was ticketed at Rs 450. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to build an audience now and see if we can hold reading fests later,&rdquo; says Malhotra.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Reader&rsquo;s corner</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">It&rsquo;s not only book clubs that are promoting a reading culture. Eateries, too, are doing their bit. Bombay to Barcelona (a caf&eacute; in Andheri) and Mockingbird Caf&eacute; and Bar (Churchgate) are encouraging people to grab a book with their bite. The latter has a collection of over a thousand books to choose from.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Amin Sheikh, owner, Bombay to Barcelona says, &ldquo;We have collected over 350 books [the cafe opened on August 15]. Patrons can pick up any book and take it home. When they return it, we ask them to write down their reading experience and a short review for others to refer to.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">If you&rsquo;re someone who used to be an avid reader and lost the reading habit, now is the best time to get back to books. If millennials can choose literature over social media, anyone can.</span></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/social-media1475918300659.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"social media"},{"text":"book review"},{"text":"mumbai"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd0990a438e57c3bf1c3bd","status":"Published","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-08T09:18:29.249Z","udate":"2016-10-10T05:25:05.723Z","expirydate":"2017-01-01T09:16:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-08T09:47:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f8b9e5b547d25d4f55bb1f","id":"57f8b9e5b547d25d4f55bb1d","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out5602.mp3","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"tagsForSearch":"social media,book review,mumbai","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Published by Penguin India, it was selected for the prestigious Man Asian International Prize that year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Four years later, Benyamin's story&nbsp;<em>Kumari Devi</em>&nbsp;comes to English readers in a limpid translation by the writer, Veena Muthuraman, on the app developed by Juggernaut Books. At around 9,000 words, it seems perfectly tailored to be read on a handheld device. The style is accessible, the narrative flow linear and the plot engaging without being too complex or demanding intense concentration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Most readers coming to&nbsp;<em>Kumari Devi</em>&nbsp;via&nbsp;<em>Goat Days</em>&nbsp;will find it hard not to compare it with the writer's earlier, and undoubtedly more superior, work, though the ostensibly different subjects of these stories may make any comparison unfair.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><em>Goat Days</em>&nbsp;tells the story of Najeeb, a Malayali man who migrates to one of the Gulf nations in search of prosperity, but becomes a slave to a cruel master there. Driven to the brink of despair by a life of misery and extreme hardship, Najeeb,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/POMekzI7Lf7gwH8FmLfJ4O/Jaipur-Literature-Festival--Beastly-tales-A-conversation-w.html\">a real-life character</a>&nbsp;on whom Benyamin based his story, tries to flee, but is embraced only by the limitless expanse of the desert that nearly kills him in his quest for freedom.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Spiritual, in that it reminds you of the trials of Jonah and Noah in the Bible,&nbsp;<em>Goat Days</em>tells the story of an individual but also evokes the human condition of migrant life in many parts of the world. In&nbsp;<em>Kumari Devi</em>, too, the focus is on a hapless individual, a castaway, though the circumstances of her tragedy are different from that of Najeeb's.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">A middle-class Malayali couple are desperate to hire a domestic help, but the good ones, as usual, are hard to come by. Into this typical urbanite problem, alive with its third-world jokes and ironies, comes Sunina Shakya Devi, an elderly Nepali lady, who proves to be a real find, though not without her share of idiosyncrasies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Chanku, the narrator, discovers her through the Nepali watchman who works at his building and takes her to the distressed couple, Gopiettan and Geetha. While the man of the house is more than grateful with Shakya Devi's efficiency, the lady is not as pleased. For one, Shakya Devi's condition of employment includes the assurance of lodging and a steady supply of the various cosmetics she needs to maintain her heavy make-up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Trouble brews thicker when Shakya Devi is seen entertaining a queue of followers, who come seeking her blessings.

Considering we&rsquo;re talking about a man who was the British Poet Laureate and was also married (for better or worse) to Sylvia Plath, that speaks volumes for the story&rsquo;s impact. The story functions on several levels, operating as a touching modern-day fairy tale, not to mention&nbsp;an extended metaphor for the ills of the Cold War. It was also adapted in 1999 into a gorgeous and mystifyingly overlooked film, which is in turn the subject of a new book, Ramin Zahed&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>The Art of &lsquo;The Iron Giant&rsquo;</em>. As its title suggests, Zahed&rsquo;s book &mdash;&nbsp;which is out now &mdash;&nbsp;looks in detail at the making of the film, and includes previously unseen sketches, storyboards, and concept art.

The Asuras were care free and happy as long as Shukracharya, their preceptor, was with them. The valiant Devas, tired of the unequal struggle, went to Kach, the handsome son of Brihaspati, preceptor of the Devas and asked him to go to Shukracharya and learn the secret of Mritasanjibani.</p>\n<p>The obedient and dutiful Kacha immediately set out to meet Shukracharya. He humbly presented himself before the great wise man, introduced himself as the son of Brihaspati, and asked to become his disciple.</p>\n<p>Shukracharya was a true teacher. He immediately recognized Kacha&rsquo;s brilliance as a student. Shukracharya did not differentiate between his students. He gave Kacha a warm welcome and accepted him as his pupil.</p>\n<p>Shukracharya had a daugher, Devayani, whom he loved dearly. He introduced Kacha to his daughter saying, \"Kacha has vowed to be my pupil till the period of his studies is over.\"</p>\n<p>Within a few days of his arrival, Kacha found himself spending all his leisure hours in the company of the lively Devayani. Devayani was slowly drawn towards Kacha and they fell in love.</p>\n<p>Shukracharya liked Kacha because he was an attentive disciple.</p>\n<p>The love between Kacha and Devayani grew day by day. The Asuras were worried. They guessed right, Kacha was there to learn the secret of Mritasanjibani.</p>\n<p>They went to one of the senior Asuras and asked him how to destroy Kacha for good. The senior Asura gave them an idea. The next day, when Kacha went out with the cattle, they again slew him. This time then burnt him in the jungle. Then they took the ashes home and mixed it in a wine which Shukracharya was very fond of. They took the drink to Shukracharya for a taste. Shukracharya loved it. He immediately drank it and blessed the Asuras.</p>\n<p>When the cattle once again returned home without Kacha Devajani knew what had happened.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He tried to console his daughter, \"It is futile Devajani to bring Kacha to life. The Asuras are determined to get rid of him. A wise soul, like you, should not grieve at a loved one's death. You are young and beautiful and you have your own life to live.\"</p>\n<p>But Devajani was adamant. So strong was her love for Kacha.</p>\n<p>Shukracharya could no longer bear to see his daughter in such agony. Again Shukracharya used his secret knowledge and called upon Kacha to come back to the world of the living. Kacha came back to life and spoke from inside the stomach of Shukracharya.</p>\n<p>\"The Asuras killed me but I do not know how I happen to be inside your stomach?\" echoed Kach.</p>\n<p>Shukracharya cursed himself for drinking the wine given by the Asuras. \"Henceforth, wine shall be forbidden for those engaged in the pursuit of wisdom,\" declared Shukracharya in great frustration. Now Shukracharya had a real dilemma of his own. He could ask Kacha to come out but that would mean his own death.</p>\n<p>When he told Debjani of his dilemma she was again adamant, \"Father, I can not live if either of you dies.\"</p>\n<p>After long deliberation Shukracharya thought of a way out. He knew now the real purpose of Kacha's visit. He addressed Kacha, \"I now see why you came and truly you have succeeded. There is only one way by which both of us can ensure Devayani's happiness. I will have to teach you the craft of Mritasanjivani.</p>\n<p>With his new knowledge Kacha emerged from Shukracharya's dying body and then immediately brought his guru back to life. Shukracharya could not have been happier with his pupil's progress.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On the last the day of his studies, Kacha went to Shukracharya for his blessing. As a wise man and a dedicated teacher, Shukracharya concealed his grudge against Kacha but he was wondering how Kacha was going to bid farewell to Devayani.</p>\n<p>Devayani waited for Kacha to propose marriage. But when Kacha broke the heart-breaking news that he was going to fulfill his obligations to his own people, her joy turned to tears. Devayani pleaded with Kacha to take her as his wife. But Kacha replied, \"Peerless one! I was reborn in your father's stomach. I am therefore your brother. I can't marry you. I must return to heaven.\"</p>\n<p>The broken-hearted Devayani cried out in her grief. She accused Kacha of using her to attain his goal. Distort she cursed Kacha, \"You will never be able to use the craft of Mritasanjivani.\"</p>\n<p>Kacha quietly listened and then spoke, \"Devayani, it is wrong to curse me. I could have walked away without reviving your father. There is no doubt that my love was sincere and truthful. But, I also have a duty to perform towards my own people. Because of your unfairness to me, I am cursing you. No Rishi's son will ever marry you. I may still teach the craft of Mritasanjivani to others, even though I may not be able to use it myself.\" Saying this Kacha departed for the abode of Indra, king of the Devas. Shukhacharya gently led Devayani away.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/Kacha03_(1)1475922673862.JPG","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","publisherSectionName":"indolink.com","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"mythological stories"},{"text":"kacha-devayani"},{"text":"mritasanjivani"},{"text":"mahabharata tales"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.indolink.com/kidz/Kacha.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-08T10:31:19.936Z","udate":"2016-10-08T10:31:19.936Z","expirydate":"2017-10-08T10:26:14.526Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-08T10:26:03.000Z","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","publiseherSectionId":"57f8caf7339bda5d32979564","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f8caf7339bda5d32979563","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6667.mp3","tagsForSearch":"mythological stories,kacha-devayani,mritasanjivani,mahabharata tales","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

They are healthy and delicious. But if you are thinking that you can just pop them into your mouth anytime and with anything, then you need to think twice. Eating fruit requires proper planning so that our body can properly digest it. In fact, if not consumed in the right way it can have adverse effects. Experts share tips to keep in mind while gorging on fruits.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>ALL FRUITS ARE THE SAME AREN&rsquo;T THEY</strong></p>\n<section class=\"story_top_news\">\n<div class=\"news_photo\"><img src=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_800x600/HT/p2/2016/09/28/Pictures/_f75fd24c-8558-11e6-aa25-6de36c266871.jpg\" /></div>\n<h2>Berries have the lowest GI and the highest polyphenols. (Photo:Shutterstock)</h2>\n</section>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most of us assume all fruits have the same goodness, but that is not the case. The optimum fruit is one which has a high level of polyphenols and a low level of glycemic index. Polyphenols are chemicals in fruits that fight inflammation in your body. Whereas Glycemic Index (GI) refers to how fast or slow the fruit will increase or decrease the glucose levels in your body. &ldquo;Fruits which have a low GI are better picks as they are digested slowly and they don&rsquo;t increase your sugar levels,&rdquo; says nutritionist Kavita Devgan. This is especially important for someone who is diabetic. &ldquo;Fruits which are darker in colour like grapes and berries have low sugar value compared to light coloured fruits like ripe bananas and melons,&rdquo; suggests Devgan. Berries have the lowest GI and the highest polyphenols.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>SPACE THY FRUITS</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ideal way to consume fruit is when your stomach is not full. Fruits when eaten on empty or half-empty stomach are quickly digested. However, this is not the case if the fruit is eaten right after a meal or on a full stomach. Then, it might cause indigestion and acidity. When fruit is consumed right after a meal or with another meal, then it stays in the stomach for a longer period and may start to rot and ferment in the gut. &ldquo;Space your meals, especially fruits. If you are consuming three meals a day, then having fruits as a snack in the evening is a good idea. Just ensure there is at least a two hour gap between your evening fruit bowl and lunch. You can also consume them in the morning after breakfast with a 1-2 hour gap,&rdquo; suggests Devgan.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>DON&rsquo;T PEEL THE PEEL</strong></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fruits which can be consumed with the peel should be consumed with the peel. &ldquo;The peel of the fruit is the source of antioxidants, vitamins and minerals. In fact, the peel of the fruits is also the main source of fibre which is essential for a healthy bowl movement,&rdquo; says nutritionist Tripti Tandon. Wash the fruits before consuming them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>DRINKING YOUR FRUIT AIN&rsquo;T SUCH A GOOD IDEA</strong></p>\n<section class=\"story_top_news\">\n<div class=\"news_photo\"><img src=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_800x600/HT/p2/2016/09/29/Pictures/organic-juice-blended-from-a-juice-machine_b5cecd88-8611-11e6-92b8-e7f1e026a3c4.jpg\" /></div>\n<h2>Consuming fruits in raw form is more beneficial than consuming it as a juice .</h2>\n</section>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Smoothies and fruit juice may contain various fruits but it does not offer you the same nutritional benefits as eating a fruit on its own. &ldquo;Adding various fruits into a blender along dry fruits will strip the fruit of its peel and the nutrients. And combining it with other fruits will only make its glceymic index high,&rdquo; states nuritionist Tripti Tandon.

How does one define nationalism? Are there any similarities between conflicts in India and its neighbours? These are some of the questions author Ramachandra Guha has attempted to answer in his latest collection of essays, <em>Democrats and Dissenters(Penguin Random House, Rs.699)</em>, a collection of 16 essays which focuses on these themes and also encompasses essays on neighbouring countries such as Pakistan and Sri Lanka and character sketches of intellectuals such as UR Ananthamurthy.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">At the launch of his book in Bengaluru, Guha pointed out, &ldquo;I think a true nationalist is someone who has a deep sense of shame about the wrongs their governments have committed. It is important for a nationalist to criticise the government when it commits mistakes. In the Indian context, a nationalist would be someone who respects the Indian constitution.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In conversation with researcher Achal Prabhala, he pointed out, &ldquo;I feel that the rise of agitation politics has been a major impediment to free speech. You cannot provide a dispassionate analysis of any historical character without the fear of protests or offending someone. Regressive colonial laws are also used to silence writers. Gandhi did not want books to be banned unless they explicitly condoned violence.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He adds, &ldquo;English writers do not get impacted as much as those working in regional languages. In the last few years, we have seen murders of popular writers who wrote primarily in Marathi and Kannada.&rdquo;</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">On a question about his experience on social media, Guha says, &ldquo; I have a twitter account. I do not use Facebook. I was warned that I would need a thick skin to negotiate Twitter. I mostly use it as a medium for sharing things that interest me, including articles of people I admire such as Mukul Kesavan. I face my share of regular trolling, but think that most of the vile abuse is directed at women, who do not agree with many of the trolls.&rdquo;</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Guha terms the Indian Left a rather strange animal. He says, &ldquo;I cannot understand their strange opposition to the common civil code or the lack of support to Taslima Nasreen.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He argues that the Congress is in terminal decline. He is not very pleased with the BJP either and says, &ldquo;The Congress has used academic posts as instruments of patronage.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, often the best person is not appointed, but the second or the third best person is because she/he is seen as more loyal to the first family or the party.

This would ultimately cause blood sugar and insulin levels to increase, which over time can lead to insulin resistance elsewhere in the body,\" Herman explained.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To test their hypothesis, researchers studied mice that were genetically altered so their liver insulin signalling pathways were maximally activated in other words, their livers should not have been able to produce any glucose.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The researchers found that even in these mice, eating fructose triggered ChREBP-related processes in the liver, causing it to make more and more glucose, despite insulin signals telling it to stop.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Previous studies have reported that high fructose diets can cause multiple metabolic problems in humans and animals, including insulin resistance and fatty liver disease.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The finding could also help scientists one day diagnose metabolic disorders earlier on, potentially allowing patients to make changes to their diets and lifestyles sooner to prevent more serious complications.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation.</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/sugar1475927860002.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babc1e73031e7ec856e9a3","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"sugar"},{"text":"fructose"},{"text":"metabolic disease"},{"text":"insulin"},{"text":"diabetes"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Health/2016-10-03/Does-eating-too-much-sugar-cause-diabetes/256820","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-08T11:57:46.805Z","udate":"2016-10-09T05:17:10.983Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T05:17:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f8df3af2efff597a39679f","id":"57f8df3af2efff597a39679d","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out8709.mp3","tagsForSearch":"sugar,fructose,metabolic disease,insulin,diabetes","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

She&rsquo;s going to be even more surprised now that I have just published a children&rsquo;s edition of the epic. But it wasn&rsquo;t until she expressed her astonishment that I realised how odd it must seem that a person could spend the best part of her life with the same story, that too, a story from about two and half thousand years ago, a story that had been told by so many people in so many languages, a story that had been painted and sculpted and sung and danced and performed so extensively and so diversely over the centuries.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And here I must confess that although there are &lsquo;three hundred Ramayanas&rsquo;, I work only with Valmiki&rsquo;s text. His is the first version of Rama&rsquo;s story that we have but it&rsquo;s also the version that people know the least, perhaps because it&rsquo;s in Sanskrit. My thirty-year obsession with the Ramayana is thus even stranger &minus; not unlike a scholar spending all their working life reading only the first folio edition of The Tempest.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_800x600/HT/p2/2016/09/30/Pictures/_28eea75e-870a-11e6-92b8-e7f1e026a3c4.jpg\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like so many other Indians, I first heard the story of the Ramayana at home, in the lap of an old woman who told it with passion and flourish and with many tears and much laughter. I remember being afraid that Ravana would come and carry me off when the lights were out, but I was also enthralled by a tale about kings and noble princes and wicked stepmothers, beautiful, sad, princesses and a wonderful, magical, heroic monkey.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was in my early 20s when I began to study Ramayana formally. I learned Sanskrit and began to immerse myself in the original text to think about Hanuman &ndash; who was this monkey who could fly and speak Sanskrit with an ease that I envied? Part animal, part god, yet wholly human, he is a character we had never before seen in Sanskrit literature. How was he imagined? What did he &lsquo;mean&rsquo;? Hanuman bhakts will tell you that you cannot reach Rama without going past Hanuman and so it was for me. My questions about Hanuman remain unanswered but the magnificent monkey became my entry point into the fascinating, infinitely complex story about human love and duty and existential choices, a story that holds my 55-year-old self in the same thrall as it did the five-year-old child who listened so earnestly at bedtime.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And now, I must ask myself what is it about Valmiki&rsquo;s Ramayana that has kept me riveted through most of my adult life. Like all good relationships, this one has not always been easy but it has always been compelling. There are times when the text has frustrated me, its characters have made me angry, its story has seemed one-dimensional. There is much in the text that still disturbs me, but there is also so much in the text that continues to excite me &ndash; the fact that it reaches the edges of the human imagination in, for example, the wonders of Hanuman, the subtle suggestions of the darkness in every human heart (Kaikeyi&rsquo;s harsh demands on the old king to secure her own son&rsquo;s position or Sita&rsquo;s inexplicable desire for the golden deer, whether dead or alive), the exploration of the essential conflict between the public and the private self.</p>\n<section class=\"story_top_news\">\n<div class=\"news_photo\"><img src=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_800x600/HT/p2/2016/09/30/Pictures/_3ec2e264-870c-11e6-92b8-e7f1e026a3c4.jpg\" /></div>\n<h2>Arshia Sattar (Courtesy Juggernaut)</h2>\n</section>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I am constantly told by peers and colleagues and friends that the Mahabharata is the &lsquo;better&rsquo; text &ndash; it is deeper, more problematic, raises harder questions, depicts humans as real people rather than idealised figures who behave in apparently easy conformity with social and patriarchal expectations. I am often asked how a woman who calls herself a feminist in the 21st century could have any sympathy for a man who made his wife prove her chastity and then abandoned her because of sly town gossip? How could I be even interested in this man who chose his duties as a king over his obligations as a husband? It has been precisely these questions that have kept me glued to the story &ndash; for often it&rsquo;s the things that we don&rsquo;t entirely understand that bind them to us.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">How do we understand Rama, let alone understand the traditions that elevate him to the position of the &lsquo;ideal man&rsquo;? The problems of the Ramayana are human and they are universal &minus; especially in Valmiki&rsquo;s Ramayana where Rama is seen as man as much as god. How do we negotiate love and loyalty when they go against what we know to be right and good? Where do we draw the line between obligations to others and being true to ourselves? If the Ramayana suggests that it&rsquo;s easy to do the right thing (as Rama does), what it does not resolve is how to react when the right thing has horrible consequences, when the results of a right and good act go very, very wrong.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Valmiki&rsquo;s epic elevates the pitch of these basic, everyday questions by placing them in a story about kings and princes and queens and demons whose private lives must be lived out in public, whose actions and motivations have far-reaching consequences beyond the home and the family. The pitch becomes higher still when these thoughts and deeds and motivations become those of a god acting in the world of humans.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_800x600/HT/p2/2016/09/30/Pictures/shriram_43f48a26-870c-11e6-92b8-e7f1e026a3c4.jpg\" /></p>\n<section class=\"story_top_news\">\n<h2>Hanuman meeting Sita at the Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra&rsquo;s Ram Lila in New Delhi on October 20, 2015. (Ajay Aggarwal/HT)</h2>\n</section>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">How we judge the characters in the story and their actions has everything to do with who we are. The same holds true for me. As I have grown and changed, I find that my relationship with the characters in the Ramayana has also changed &ndash; my own loves and losses, triumphs and successes have refocused the lens through which I view the actions of Rama and Sita and their companions. Each time I read the Ramayana, I find something new that draws me into its magnetic field, something that tells me as much about myself as it does about the story and how it works in our lives. I used to be mesmerised by Rama&rsquo;s cruel words to Sita at the end of the war, when he asks her to go to anyone she pleases, even to his brothers. But over the years, I&rsquo;ve come to think more about Sita&rsquo;s response to him &ndash; her dignity and complete clarity when she tells Rama that if he thinks this of her, then he has not known her at all. This is the Sita that I found in Valmiki years after I thought I knew the text as well as I ever would.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My mother is convinced that my obsession with the Ramayana is because I was bitten by a monkey when I was three years old. I remember the incident in bits and pieces, fragmentary images of the cage, the baby monkey, the metallic cold of the lab table on which I had to sit for the injection I had to take. Like so many other childhood memories, this one, too, has developed a dream-like quality over the years, changing shape and colour, blurring at the edges, but entirely true in what it can evoke. It&rsquo;s been a ha-ha story for family and friends, part adventure, part lucky escape, part legend.

A lot of people would not know how to read 140/&lt;90 mm Hg and 100-199 mg/dL unless explained. Making sure that you can decode these numbers will help you immensely to keep your heart&nbsp;<a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/health\">health</a> in check. Doctors recommend that one must get frequent check-ups done. Here are a some numbers you must know more about...<br /><br /><strong>Blood Pressure &lt;140/&lt;90 mm Hg</strong><br />The force of blood against the blood vessel walls as the heart pumps blood, is blood pressure. It is measured by a device that uses Hg or the height of a column of mercury, to show the circulating systolic and diastolic pressures. The first number systolic pressure is the peak pressure in the arteries, and diastolic pressure is the lowest pressure. Systolic measures artery pressure when the heart is contracted and diastolic measures it when the heart is relaxed. Normal is around 130/80 mm Hg though, for some, it may<br />be lower.<br /><br /><strong>Total Cholesterol 100-199 mg/dL</strong><br />Cholesterol is a factor that increases your chances of developing heart disease. But since it has no symptoms, one must keep a check. There is good cholesterol, HDL, and bad cholesterol, LDL and the combined levels should be around 100-199 mg/dL. The HDL should be above 45 mg/dL and the LDL below 130 mg/dL.<br /><br /><strong>Exercise 30 minutes, daily</strong><br />Reams have been written about how regular exercise essential. Experts state that every day spending at least 30 to 40 minutes exercising (aerobics, swimming and brisk walking) can reduce your risk of developing a heart ailment.<br /><br /><strong>Blood Sugar &lt;100 mg/dL</strong><br />The sugar in our blood provides us our daily energy and to allow it to enter cells insulin is needed. Too much sugar in your blood, however, can lead to <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Diabetes\">diabetes</a> and heart disease. The blood sugar levels varies widely from person to person. The general recommended level is fasting sugar less than 100mg/dl.<br /><br /><strong>BMI 18.5-24.9</strong><br />One of the strong risk factors for heart disease is obesity. The BMI or the body mass index is one way to measure it. A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is healthy. Anything less or more could indicate a problem.<br />*The figures mentioned apply to an average adult.

{"_id":"57f8e657b547d25d4f55bce1","title":"36 books written on the great epic Mahabharat","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fb6af76df6bbfd6adfc","content":"<div class=\"articleLead\">\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</h2>\n</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">I never met Prabhakar Shrotriya but his critical appreciation of Kalidasa&rsquo;s immortal poem &ldquo;Meghdootam&rdquo; had impressed me a lot when I read it many years ago. Titled &ldquo;Meghdoot: Ek Antaryatra&rdquo; (Meghdoot: An Innter Journey), it was an exploration aimed at bringing out the hidden or not-too-obvious meanings and nuances woven into the fabric of the poem. It was also an exposition of the physical and aesthetic beauty of India as well as a celebration of the Yaksha&rsquo;s love for his beloved. Therefore, when news came that Shrotriya had passed away on September 15 at the age of 78, I felt sad and, at the same time, inspired to read his other writings.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Published by Bharatiya Jnanpith, his magnum opus, \"Bharat Main Mahabharata\" (Mahabharata in India) is a critical study of the epic and offers a panoramic view of its presence and influence in India and abroad. The book&rsquo;s vast canvas reminds us of Vasudev Sharan Agrawala&rsquo;s classic \"Bharat Savitri\" that studies, analyses and interprets the epic from a cultural historian&rsquo;s point of view.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shrotriya&rsquo;s book is different as it explores the amazingly great influence that the epic has exercised over the Indian mind during the past several millennia and has remained a treasure house of rich source material for a large number of philosophical and literary works in Sanskrit and other Indian languages. He very rightly defines an immortal work as one that inspires successive generations of writers and constantly goes on to renew itself in works that owe their origins to it. In this sense, the Mahabharata is truly immortal.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shrotriya has expanded on this theme in another book titled \"Shasvatoyam\" (This is Eternal). Published by Vani Prakashan, the book offers a new interpretation as well as evaluation of 44 stories from the epic. Shrotriya also underscores the fact that the stories (upakhyans) of Mahabharata that have no real organic relationship with the main Kaurav-Pandav narrative happen to be the ones that have often been chosen by later writers to base their literary works on. \"Shakuntalam\" of Kalidasa is the prime example of this trend.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As Shrotriya is primarily a writer and critic &ndash; his oeuvre consists of nearly two dozen books of poetry, plays, essays, literary criticism and translation &ndash; he places considerable emphasis on feelings, sentiments, emotions and ideas that permeate and inform the great epic and he is not unduly concerned with determining its core or later interpolations. Although he admires the work done by scholars such as V. S. Sukthankar who was the main inspiration behind the Critical Edition of the Mahabharata brought out by Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, yet he maintains that the critical textual analysis of the text to determine and separate its various layers is immaterial to the task of understanding its meaning and import. For that, one has to treat the epic as an organic whole despite knowing full well that it has undergone many a redaction over several thousand years.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is Prabhakar Shrotriya&rsquo;s considered view that the Mahabharata is a work whose central message is humanism as Vyas, its putative creator, declares towards the end of the epic that there is no higher truth than the Man himself. He also views it essentially as an \"anti-war\" treatise. This is in fact the main reason why the epic continues to capture the Indian imagination and has been a source of important works of literary theory, ethics, history, poetry, plays and fiction in all the major Indian languages including Sanskrit, Prakrit, Apbhransha and Urdu. The epic did not remain confined to India and cast its net right up to Cambodia, Vietnam and China besides Indonesia, Bali, Thailand, Java, Malaya and Japan. All these countries have their own versions of the Mahabharata and its various stories.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Great Kannada poet Pampa, who was a Jain monk, made the first attempt to recreate the epic in a modern Indian language in the 10th Century and this version is known after his name as &ldquo;Pampa Bharata&rdquo;. Assamese and Telugu are the only two Indian languages in which the task of rendering the Mahabharata in the indigenous language was undertaken and completed by many poets over many centuries. The work began in the 11th Century in both the languages but was finished in Telugu by the 14th Century involving three poets. However, it took eight centuries and eighteen poets in Assamese to complete this vast enterprise. In the 14th Century, Tamil poet Villiputturar wrote &ldquo;Villi Bharatham&rdquo; although attempts to render the epic in Tamil had started as early as the fifth century.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the 15th Century, Sarla Das re-created the Mahabharata in Oriya and turned it into an anti-feudal narrative that attempted to establish the centrality and importance of the Shudras. In Gujarati, &ldquo;Bheelon Ka Bharatha&rdquo; (The Bheel&rsquo;s Bharatha) was an expression of the Bheel tribals&rsquo; imagination, sentiments and creativity. It placed Draupadi at the centre of the epic and turned it into a matriarchal narrative. In the 16th century, Ezhuthachan, who is considered to be the father of the Malayalam language, recast the epic into a new genre called Killipattu while making a parrot as its main narrator.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In our times, Michael Madhusudan Dutta, Rabindranath Tagore, Subrahmanya Bharathi, Maithili Sharan Gupta, Jaishankar Prasad, Dharmvir Bharati, Vishnu Sakharam Binder, Girish Karnad, Buddhadev Basu, S. L. Bhairappa, Iravati Karve, K. M. Munshi, Madhusudan Ray, Fakir Mohan Senapati, C. Rajagopalachari and scores of other important writers have based their creative works on the Mahabharata. Until I read \"Bharat Main Mahabharata\", I had no idea that at least 36 books had so far been written on the great epic in Urdu since the late 19th century.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/maha1475929679336.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babcefb210157e920b07f9","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"36 books written on the great epic mahabharat"},{"text":"mahabharat"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/no-full-stops/article9169027.ece","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-08T12:28:07.072Z","udate":"2016-12-17T10:52:09.834Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T12:27:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-08T12:26:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f8e657b547d25d4f55bce3","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6807.mp3","audioImageUrl":"","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"tagsForSearch":"36 books written on the great epic mahabharat,mahabharat","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57f8e6bf4a8d835943bd35e4","title":"Ramanuja: Philosopher and devotee","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fb6af76df6bbfd6adfc","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/excerpts-from-%E2%80%98philosophers/\">EXCERPTS FROM &lsquo;PHILOSOPHERS</a>&nbsp;L<a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/leaders/\">EADERS</a>'</span></p>\n<div class=\"articleLead\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<h2>Love and surrender were the two ways he advocated.</h2>\n</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">An appellation by which Ramanuja was called is &lsquo;Ubhaya-Vedanta-Pravartaka.&rsquo; It means the propagator of two schools of Vedanta - the Vedanta found in the works of the Azhwars, known as Nalayira Divya Prabandham, and the Vedanta which found its expression in philosophers who wrote their works in Sanskrit and who were the Acharya-predecessors of Ramanuja.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ramanuja, as an individual, had his dominant characteristic - being compassionate towards the lowly - as is evidenced in many incidents that one comes across in the traditional account of his life. One of the verses in which he was honoured by his followers reads thus: &ldquo;<em>yo nityam achyuta-padambuja-yugma- rukma-vyamohatastaditarani trunaya mene asmad guror bhagavato &lsquo;sya dayaika-sindhoh Ramanujasya charanau saranam prapadhye</em>.&rdquo; This may be roughly translated as follows : &ldquo;I resort to the sacred feet of that Bhagavan Ramanuja who is the very ocean of compassion, our Master, who in his fascination for the golden lotus feet of Lord Achyuta, deemed everything else as trifling as a blade of grass.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">That Ramanuja was both a philosopher and a devotee is expressed in the first verse of his great commentary on the Brahmasutras known as Sri-bhashya. The verse runs thus: &lsquo;<em>Akhila-bhuvana-janma-sthema-bhangadi-lile, vinata-vividha-bhuta-vrata-rakshaika-dikshe sruti-sirasi vidipte Brahmani Srinivase bhavatu mama parasmin semushi bhakti-rupa.</em>&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;May my knowledge of God gathered from the study of the scriptures, the pages of which are illumined by His light, ripen into the ardent love for Him, who is the creator, sustainer and the annihilator of this whole universe and who has pledged himself to redeem the souls of those who bow down to Him in all humility.&rdquo; This is the keynote of his entire philosophy of life known as Bhaktirupapanna-jnana (knowledge transformed into love).</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ramanuja was a God-intoxicated soul and every page of his writings reflects his devotion to God and to all that belongs to God.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The traditional life of Ramanuja is narrated in three important works such as &lsquo;Guruparampara-prabhava,&rsquo; &lsquo;Divya- suri-charita&rsquo; and &lsquo;Prapannamrita.&rsquo; &lsquo;Guruparampara-prabhava&rsquo; is a work written in what is known as the Manipravala style, a mixture of Tamil and Sanskrit, while &lsquo;Divya-suri-charita&rsquo; and &lsquo;Prapannamrita&rsquo; are in Sanskrit. These three works give an account of Ramanuja&rsquo;s life and that of the Azhwars and the philosophers known as the Acharyas. We can only pick out a few incidents from the traditional account of his life.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ramanuja went forth on his mission preaching his philosophy of bhakti or loving devotion and prapatti or absolute and unqualified self-surrender to God wherever he went. He became a parivrajaka, a wanderer in a quest for the truth. He is said to have travelled extensively throughout India and to Kashmir where he came across the commentary of Bodhayana, which acted as a great inspiration to his own interpretation of Vedic and Upanishadic texts. In the course of his stay in Tamil Nadu, when he was about seventy-eight, it is said he was subjected to persecution for his philosophical and religious views by a king who was reigning then and Ramanuja moved to Karnataka where he stayed for a few years before he returned to Tamil Nadu. It was while he was in Karnataka that he wielded great influence on Bittideva, a king of the Hoysala country and converted him from Jainism to Vaishnavism. The king who was given the name Vishnuvardhana was responsible for the building of the beautiful temple of Kesava at Belur. The Catholicism of Ramanuja and the broad-mindedness of Hoysala Vishnuvardhana found their expression in one of the verses inscribed on the compound wall of this Kesava temple.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ramanuja, while travelling across Karnataka, stayed at Melkote or Tirunarayanapuram, where he restored and consecrated a temple dedicated to Lord Narayana. It was due to Ramanuja&rsquo;s efforts that even today, the Vairamudi festival held at Melkote temple is open to people from all walks of life.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ramanuja founded a math at Melkote which is known as Yatiraja Matha. Yatiraja or the Prince of Ascetics being the name, by which the followers of Ramanuja adored him.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">We describe God as the form of truth, goodness and beauty, with an emphasis on the first two. And Ramanuja described the Lord as &lsquo;Divya-mangala-vigraha.&rsquo; In his works he described God as the very embodiment of beauty (saundarya), grace (lavanya), sweetness (madhurya) and magnanimous (audarya). According to Ramanuja, the perfect form of beauty is found only in the supernal form of the Divine Being, who has to be approached successfully only through love (bhakti) and self-surrender (prapatti).</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">This truth is brought out by another incident traditionally narrated, according to which Ramanuja succeeded in turning the love of one Dhanurdasa, who was engrossed in the beauty of his own beloved, towards the supreme beauty of the Lord. Ramanuja held Dhanurdasa as an example for all his disciples to emulate.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another incident that is worthy of mention relates to the simplicity and innocence of Ramanuja despite his stupendous learning and the eminent position that he held among the teachers of Vedanta. One day he was walking along the street where a few children were playing on the mud by building a temple, installing in it an image of the deity made by themselves and enveloping the mock temple with a prakaram and a gopuram usually found in great temples. Once done the boys asked Ramanuja to prostrate before the idol of their worship and receive the prasadam consisting of knick-knacks offered by the urchins to the Lord. Ramanuja closed his eyes, folded his palms and fell prostrate as he was bidden by the children. He felt in his heart that one has to grow innocent as a child, in order to easily approach God.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ramanuja&rsquo;s doctrine of prapatti or self-surrender finds its essence in his interpretation of the 66th verse of the eighteenth chapter of the Gita which runs thus: <em>sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja aham twam sarva-papebhyo mokshayishyami ma suchah</em> &ldquo;Abandon all duties and resort to Me alone. I shall cleanse thee of all thy sins; do not grieve.&rdquo; Ramanuja and his Vaishnava tradition looks upon this verse as indicative of abhaya-pradana or the grant of fearlessness which God assures His devotees.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The idea of prapatti or self-surrender finds its most moving and poetic expression in Saranagati-gadya which is a dialogue between (Ramanuja?) himself and the God of his vision. In the Sriranga-gadya Ramanuja betrays his great fondness of the archavatara (iconographical manifestation) of Ranganatha at Srirangam where he spent many precious years of his life. He closes this prose poem with these words : &ldquo;O Ranganatha! My Lord! I bow to Thee.&rdquo; In Srivaikunta-gadya, Ramanuja dreams of the kingdom of God in the everlasting companionship and communion with the Divine Being. His last work, Nitya-grantha, is a manual for worshipping the deity.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The post-Ramanuja period threw up several great teachers who continued the tradition of the philosophical and religious thought of India, whose interpretation of the words of their great master, though substantially the same, differed in a few minor details. Nevertheless, they held aloft the torch of Ramanuja&rsquo;s gospel of life. Among these great teachers, we have Vedanta Desikar, Pillai Lokacharya and Manavala Mamuni. They wrote works, some of these being in Sanskrit and some in Tamil, giving a brilliant exposition of &lsquo;Ubhaya Vedanta&rsquo; of which Ramanuja was the foremost teacher.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ramanuja is one of the greatest spiritual teachers and religious reformers that the world has seen. His message of Bhakti for the Supreme Being and love for all, converted thousands of hearts. It is the vitalising influence of great spiritual teachers that has made it possible for Hinduism to stay unaffected through centuries.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">(These are extracts from &lsquo;Ramanuja,&rsquo; an article written by M. Yamunacharya in the book, &lsquo;Philosophers and Leaders,&rsquo; published (1978) by the Publications Division, The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India, and edited by Dr. V.

It is possible that the absence of the virus could be down to the conventional drugs that he has also been taking which can temporarily clear the body of the disease. \"My last blood test was a couple of weeks ago and there is no detectable virus,\" the patient said.\n<div class=\"last2brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"last1brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">HIV is able to hide from the immune system in dormant cells where sophisticated testing cannot find it, and therefore resist therapy . The treatment endeavours to trick the virus into emerging from its hiding places and then trigger the body's immune system to recognise it and attack it, an approach that has been called \"kick and kill\". The new therapy works in two stages. Firstly ,a vaccine helps the body recognise the HIV-infected cells so it can clear them out. Secondly, a new drug called Vorinostat activates the dormant Tcells so they can be spotted by the immune system.</div>\n</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/UK1475929863875.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecfa7eaf76df6bbfd6b67b","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"hiv"},{"text":"uk"},{"text":"therapy"},{"text":"antiretroviral drugs"},{"text":"virus"},{"text":"blood"},{"text":"immune system"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/UK-scientists-on-verge-of-curing-HIV/articleshow/54651892.cms","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-08T12:31:09.100Z","udate":"2016-10-09T05:17:10.983Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T05:17:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f8e70df807295d859fe4ae","id":"57f8e70df807295d859fe4ac","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out4005.mp3","tagsForSearch":"hiv,uk,therapy,antiretroviral drugs,virus,blood,immune system","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

It is transmitted through generations by word of mouth. It is based on the principle the heavenly bodies of the Cosmos exert influence on the life and mundane events on Earth.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In modern day context, it is an applied astronomy to terrestrial events. Jyotisha (Astrology) is a vedanga consisting of Ganita (Mathematical) and Phalita (Predictive) branches. As per modern scientific theory, the Universe came into existence following a huge explosion about 15 billion years ago. From this explosion, Galaxies, Stars, Planets etc., of the universe formed. Life came into existence on Earth about 4.5 billion years ago. In the solar system. Sun is at the centre and all planets including Asteroids, Meteorites, Meteoroids etc. revolve around it. Sun is a self luminous, body of the solar system and Earth is its third planet. As of now this planet only has life. The influence of Sun and Moon on Earth is a well established fact by Scientists, Doctors and Psychologists.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The present compliation gives fundamental principles of astrology arranged in a systematic way. It serves as a tool to understand the nuances of predictive principles of astrology. The entire material has been arranged in eight parts in an ascending order of complexity. The first part deals with the science of astronomy related to astrology. This gives basics of astronomy and its relation with astrology. The various gravitational forces emanating from Cosmic bodies and their influence on living and non living things on Earth is the genesis of Astrology. The second part deals with General Astrology. It covers Vedic knowledge and meaning of Jyotish Sastra.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The concept of Karma theory and its relevance of astrology has been explained. The third part is the key to horoscopy and it explains how to create a heavenly map for a particular time, i.e. construction of a horoscopes. The fourth part covers basics of predictive astrology viz karakas, karakatwas of grahas, bhavas and signs. The fifth part deals with dasha system (directional astrology), the corner stone for timing of events. This will be useful for forecasting the events on a time scale. Part six covers the rationale of transits (Gocharas) of planets and their influence on the radical positions of planets in a horoscope.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The seventh part deals with fundamentals of annual horoscopy (Tajka system). IT delineates the events which are going to happen in a year. The eighth part covers Muhurtha (Electional) astrology. This gives how to select or elect. an auspicious time for a particular event so as to avoid failures in that venture.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This compendium aims at providing fundamental principles of predictive astrology and bridges the gap between the professionals on one side and intellectuals on the other, who desire to know Jyotish Sastra.

It creates the infrastructure of ideas according to which we interpret the world. Like the limitations of our senses we seldom question the limitations of our historical view, which we take as a given fact, even though it changes with every generation. Each society creates an idea of history through which it interprets civilization in its own image.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> In the modern age science, technology and rational materialism have created an historical view that makes ancient Greece, in which the seeds of modern culture arose, the basis of civilization as a whole. It looks to the precursors of civilization in the ancient Near East, Sumeria and Egypt, from which the Greeks derived the rudiments of their culture.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">This view ignores or denigrates other ancient traditions like those of India, China or Mesoamerica as of little importance. Indeed if we examine books on world history today we discover that they are largely histories of modern Europe, with non-European cultures turned into a mere footnote, or simply dismissed as primitive, that is not technologically advanced, however spiritually or artistically evolved they may have been.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> In the post-colonial era, however, we are now questioning this Euro centric and materialistic view of humanity. We are recognizing the value of traditional cultures and indigenous peoples, whose mistreatment and devaluation now appears on par with the destruction of our natural environment that we have been hastily promoting in the name of material progress.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">With a new understanding of depth psychology, mythology and comparative religion we are gaining a greater appreciation of spiritual ways of life, like the science of yoga, which developed outside of both the European and Middle Eastern cultural matrixes. A number of racial, ethnic and religious groups have challenged their negative portrayal in modern Euro centric historical accounts.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> For example, the European conquest of America, which was previously regarded as the benign expansion of advanced European civilization, is now being reinterpreted as a genocide of native peoples and destruction of their ancient cultures. Non-European cultures are no longer accepting the European interpretation of their histories, which not surprisingly makes their cultures inferior to that of Europe.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">This movement of historical rectification is bringing about a revolution in our view of history that is only just beginning and is bound to change our idea of who we are as human beings. India is another country whose history has been greatly distorted by a colonial and materialistic European bias. India was the foremost of the British colonies and the center for the spiritual view of humanity that the materialistic mind has ever opposed.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> Now historians of ancient India are raising questions about the Euro centric interpretation of Indian history and bringing forth new views that give greater validity to the traditional culture and literature of the subcontinent which has always emphasized the spiritual life.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: black;\">In this article we will examine important new discoveries in regard to ancient India that show the need for a radical reexamination of the history of the region. A careful study of the data today reveals that existing accounts of ancient India and thereby world history as well - particularly the Aryan invasion theory which is the cornerstone of the Euro centric interpretation of India - are contrary to all the evidence and need to be totally altered.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> This is indeed a bold statement but, if true as the facts outlined below will indicate, requires changing the entire way in which Indian civilization has been evaluated.</span></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/the_myth_of_the_aryan_invasion_of_india_nab0031475916509857.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"aryan invasion"},{"text":"history of india"},{"text":"myths in history"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","statsId":"57f8e76af6280d58e8c2c014","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out9618.mp3","priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-08T12:32:42.656Z","udate":"2016-10-08T12:32:42.656Z","expirydate":"2016-10-07T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-08T08:26:00.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"sno":1,"showEditableRow":false,"tagsForSearch":"aryan invasion,history of india,myths in history","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

First, why did this patient die? It is quite rare for a Zika infection to cause severe illness in adults, much less death. Second, how did another individual, who visited the first while in the hospital, become ill from Zika? This second patient did not do anything that was known at the time to put people at risk for contracting the virus. Researchers at the University of Utah School of Medicine and ARUP Laboratories in Salt Lake City begin to unravel the mystery in correspondence published online on September 28 in <em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em>. Details from the two cases point to an unusually high concentration of virus in the first patient&rsquo;s blood as being responsible for his death. &ldquo;This case expands our appreciation for how Zika virus can potentially spread from an infected patient to a non-infected patient without sexual contact or a mosquito vector,&rdquo; says Marc Couturier, co author of the study. &ldquo;This and any future cases will force the medical community to critically re-evaluate established triage processes for determining which patients receive Zika testing and which do not.&rdquo; &mdash; Science Daily</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Update on mosquito spit</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mosquito saliva influences transmission of viruses to a bitten mammalian host. For example, it contains factors that dampen the host immune response and so facilitate infection. A study published in PLOS<em>Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> reports on a saliva protein with the opposite effect: D7, a protein present in<em>Aedes aegypti </em>saliva, binds to the Dengue virus (DENV) and inhibits its transmission to human cells and mice. Antibodies against D7, which are present in humans exposed to mosquito bites, might therefore facilitate virus transmission and enhance disease severity. The researchers had previously isolated proteins from the salivary glands of <em>Aedes aegypti</em>, the mosquito that transmits the dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses, and tested batches of proteins to see if they could either enhance or block DENV transmission to human cells. In this study, they focussed on proteins that could inhibit DENV.</p>","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babcefb210157e920b07f9","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"sea life"},{"text":"microfibres"},{"text":"microplastic pollution"},{"text":"parenting"},{"text":"zika transmission"},{"text":"mosquito spit"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/around-the-world-october-2-2016/article9174499.ece","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-08T12:50:33.853Z","udate":"2016-10-09T05:17:10.983Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T05:17:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f8eb995c9c08595eb55ff2","id":"57f8eb995c9c08595eb55ff0","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out4124.mp3","tagsForSearch":"sea life,microfibres,microplastic pollution,parenting,zika transmission,mosquito spit","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

It is a new synthetic material that can be implanted under the skin as a scaffold for new bone to grow on, or used to replace lost bone matter altogether. Surgeons currently replace shattered or missing bones with a number of things. The most common option is an autograft where a piece of bone is taken from a patient&rsquo;s own body, usually from a hip or a rib, and implanted where it&rsquo;s needed elsewhere in the same patient&rsquo;s skeleton. Surgeons prefer autografts because they&rsquo;re real bone complete with stem cells that give rise to cartilage and bone cells to provide extra support for the new graft. Researchers at Northwestern University, U.S., say that the hyperelastic bone (made of hydroxyapatite, a naturally occurring mineral that exists in our bones and teeth) will provide strength to create bone.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The idea is that a patient would come in with a nasty broken bone &mdash; say, a shattered jaw &mdash; and instead of going through painful autograft surgeries or waiting for a custom scaffold to be manufactured, he or she could be X-rayed and a 3D-printed hyperelastic bone scaffold could be printed that same day. &mdash; Science Mag</div>","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babcefb210157e920b07f9","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"hyperelastic bone"},{"text":"hb"},{"text":"reconstructive surgery"},{"text":"skin"},{"text":"bone"},{"text":"northwestern university"},{"text":"u.s."}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/demystifying-science-what-is-a-hyperelastic-bone/article9174500.ece","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-08T12:53:34.148Z","udate":"2016-10-09T05:17:10.983Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T05:17:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f8ec4eb547d25d4f55bcf8","id":"57f8ec4eb547d25d4f55bcf6","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out8987.mp3","tagsForSearch":"hyperelastic bone,hb,reconstructive surgery,skin,bone,northwestern university,u.s.","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

{"_id":"57f9ca1cf807295d859fe5e4","title":"The beauty of Daagh","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8f9558d3f458eaf44114","content":"<div class=\"articleLead\">\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">A three-day seminar in Hyderabad examined the evocative idiom of Daagh Dehalvi&rsquo;s poetry.</h2>\n</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">An epic narrative of literature and language is hardly shaped by the creative dexterity of its outstanding exponents whose writings leave the readers awe-struck but the battle for corporeal immortality is invariably won by the prodigious effusion of the middle-of-the-road poets and authors of a particular language. A poetry that does not turn on unsettling questions may shape the narrative imagination of those who want to enjoy the tales of their quirks and triumphs wrapped in evocative idiom.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The popularity of language owes much to this sort of poets and authors who fashion multi-stranded narrative without taking recourse to existential or solipsistic questioning. This is the reason that prompted Maulana Azad National Urdu University to focus attention on Nawab Mirza Khan Daagh Dehlavi (1831-1905) recently. Daagh Delhavi, still very popular with singers and common readers, has been forsaken by the highbrow critics and art aficionados for many years and the university tried to relieve his whole creative journey by organising a three-day event on him.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Daagh, whose oeuvre seems inanimate, turns to be aesthetically alive as Professor Abul Kalam, Chairman, Department of Urdu, did not restrict himself to initiate an informed debate on Daagh&rsquo;s poetic contribution across all genres of poetry but also tried to resuscitate him by making him the object of creative feedback in the form of short story and poetry. Besides critics who take pains in critically evaluating his poetry, prominent story writers present their stories drawing on an aspect of his life and eminent poets composed verses in his &lsquo;Zameen&rsquo; (emulating Daagh&rsquo;s poetic method &ndash; same rhythm, end rhyme and meters). It is a quaint and rewarding effort that caused a stir in the literary circles.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Spelling out the dynamics of the popularity of language and exceptional authors, well known academician, Vice-Chancellor Aslam Parvez said it was not necessary that a region where a number of universally recognised authors and poets were born inspire people to adopt those languages. In south and western India, no Ghalib, Meer and Iqbal was born, but it is the area where Urdu is still a force to reckon with. Maharashtra has he largest number of Urdu medium schools and Telangana houses widely circulated Urdu newspapers. By turning attention to Daagh, the university wants to spread the awareness that Urdu is easier to get along as every day reality has caught up with it.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">For noted Urdu critic Professor Shamim Hanfi, the spread of poetry does not owe much to first rate poets as their poetry always leaves some gaps that is filled by lesser accomplished poets. Daagh&rsquo;s poetry does not conjure up big questions or subverts popular notion about human psyche but it makes his medium-Urdu, a culturally and aesthetically alive trope.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In an uncaring universe, his free swinging and mildly erotic poetry enable us to come to terms with the growing sense of estrangement and loneliness. According to him, Daagh&rsquo;s poetry itself is not great, but it does pave the way for excellent poetry.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A prominent scholar and poet Dr. Taqi Aabdi, (Canada) regretted that a poet who produced more than 200,000 couplets, is yet to be made the object of a dispassionate critical look. With his more than 4000 disciples, Daagh played a pivotal role in popularising Urdu.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Daagh was the poet who paid little attention to external reality no matter how significant it was and despite having been an eye witness to 1857, he hardly referred to it in his poetry.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A distinguished Urdu short story writer Khalid Javed, whose book published by the Penguin has received wide spread appreciation, weaved a gripping narrative of Daagh&rsquo;s dream, essentially a close encounter with death. Craftsmanship is the cornerstone of Daagh&rsquo;s poetry and his felicity with Urdu proverbs, prosody and rhetorical devices still remains unparalleled. Khalid Javed initiated a tantalising debate on the relationship that exists between art and truth. Daagh on his death bed asks his disciples to set all his creative outpourings on fire as truth eludes all his writings.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He himself admits that his poetry deeply rooted in aesthetic sensibilities does not betray truth. He subverted truth at the altar of beauty. One of his disciples disagrees by saying poetic truth is different from external reality. Poetry creates its own truth through its rhetorical devices but Daagh does not relent. Daagh strongly foretells that Ghalib and Iqbal will remain relevant in all times to come as they hardly compromised truth at the cost of beauty.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Several other short story writers like Baigh Ehsas Hameed Suharwardi, Moinuddin Jeenabade, Mohammad Zaman Azurdah , Ibne Kamual, Rizwanul Haq and Qamar Jamali presented their stories. It is the first time that life story of a poet is presented through a number of short stories which draw simultaneously on fact and fiction.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Popularity of a creative writer is not a social construct. It is based on his ability to keep poetic explanation and description alive, this was the semantic import of the event.</p>","publishersId":"57ecf66aebfe246bd8ebdfe5","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"the beauty of daagh"}],"langIdentifier":"en","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/the-beauty-of-daagh/article9163848.ece","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T04:39:56.457Z","udate":"2016-10-09T04:39:56.457Z","expirydate":"2016-12-31T04:39:45.692Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-07T04:39:38.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","title_or_id":"Translation: Bangla Dalit Poetry","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9ca1cf807295d859fe5e6","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out3406.mp3","tagsForSearch":"the beauty of daagh","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Such profound cultural ignorance is shared by thousands of Bengali writers and readers. Despite this lack of general awareness and the negligence of mainstream literary magazines, Bangla Dalit literature has been thriving. Meenakshi Mukherjee&rsquo;s seminal translation of Manoranjan Byapari&rsquo;s article &ldquo;Is there Dalit Writing in Bangla?&rdquo; (2007) served as an eye-opener by offering an overview of more than hundred years of Dalit writing in Bangla.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Namasudras, residing mostly in East Bengal, educated themselves and started writing in the first few decades of the twentieth century. However, they suffered humiliation during the 1947 partition and were not properly rehabilitated in its aftermath. As a result, the organized Namasudras scattered all over the nation. The discrimination in the treatment meted out to Savarna and Dalit refugees worked as a catalyst in worsening the condition of the Namasudras in independent India; it took enormous efforts and quite a few decades for them to reorganize themselves and produce literature.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Dalit Panther movement led by Namdeo Dhasal among others in the 1970s saw the emergence of a Dalit literary movement in Marathi. The voice of Dalit resistance against Savarna hegemony on pen and paper spread like wildfire in other languages as well; Dalit writing began to come up in Telugu, Gujrati, Tamil, Kannada, among other languages.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The national Dalit literary meets that were being organized in the eighties soon influenced the writers, poets, and intellectuals having depressed caste origins in Bengal. The Bangiya Dalit Lekhak Parishad (Bengal Dalit Writers Association) was formed in 1987. But the movement gained momentum after the suicide of Chuni Kotal in 1992. The oppressive treatment which forced this tribal scholar of Lodha origin to end her life while writing her dissertation at the Vidyasagar University in Midnapore kindled anger, sorrow, and resilience that would result in organizing the Dalit community. This culminated in the publication of a quarterly, Chaturtha Duniya (The Fourth World) in 1994. Achintya Biswas became its first editor. The name of the quarterly has a two-fold significance: on the one hand it delves into the world of the fourth varna of the Hindu caste hierarchy; on the other hand, it speaks of the fourth world that exists within the Third World. Apart from bringing out their issues in regular intervals, Chaturtha Duniya now publishes all genres of Dalit writing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shatobarsher Bangla Dalit Sahitya (One Hundred Years of Bengali Dalit Literature), edited by Manohar Mouli Biswas and Shyamal Kumar Pramanik provides a formative selection of Dalit writing in all genres&mdash;prose, poetry, fiction, and drama. Coming out from Chaturtha Duniya publications in 2011, and being influenced by Arjun Dangle&rsquo;s seminal publication&mdash;The Poisoned Bread, it is an interesting survey of the literature neither featured in the mainstream and avant garde establishments that define Bangla literature, nor found on the shelves of popular bookstores across West Bengal.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All the translations that I have rendered into English are from this anthology. I have avoided authors who have already been or are being translated; I picked the poems of poets who are comparatively unknown yet possess a distinct and powerful voice in their own right. The themes of poverty, caste discrimination, and governmental ignorance unite the five poems I have translated. They examine the relations between class and caste by expanding the scope of the term &lsquo;Dalit&rsquo; to include those who not only belong to depressed castes but also those who come from the deprived proletariat class.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unlike the Savarna poet whose text verges on becoming a narrative of sympathy, the Dalit poet identifies himself with the caste and class about which he is writing and creates a narrative of resistance. The heroes of these poems hail from a community of either minorities or untouchables; the act of writing poetry contributes to a discourse of resistance against a villainous establishment comprising discriminatory upper caste Hindus, oppressive governments, the (upper)&nbsp;middle class conformists, and political opportunists.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Contrary to Savarna narratives of sympathy that depict the misery of Dalits being crushed under the system, Dalit writing positions the Dalit hero at the centre and allows his rebellious rhetoric to be heard. It is a testimony of the subaltern speaking, a process of dismantling the Brahminical power structure with its own tools.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Over the last decade Bengali Dalit Literature has garnered much academic interest. Dissertations are being supervised, papers are being written, talks are being held, and English translations of major Dalit texts are coming out from reputed enterprises. Translations and conferences on Dalit Studies have familiarized names like Manoranjan Byapari, Manohar Mouli Biswas, Kalyani Thakur Charaal, Manju Bala, Jatin Bala, among others, to academics and researchers devoted to Dalit Studies around the globe.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Through these translations, I, a conscious Savarna-born sceptic, hope to atone for the sins committed by my casteist forefathers and contemporary relatives by making some voices relegated to the margins heard to an international audience.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/deb14752399837641475988109427.png","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"translation: bangla dalit poetry"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://desiwriterslounge.net/articles/papercuts-translation-bangla-dalit-poetry/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T04:41:56.344Z","udate":"2016-10-09T04:41:56.344Z","expirydate":"2016-12-31T04:41:40.557Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-06T04:41:35.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9ca94b38e1d5d6a0c393d","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6398.mp3","tagsForSearch":"translation: bangla dalit poetry","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

{"_id":"57f9cb5ab547d25d4f55be27","title":"Why We Need To Revisit Rumi And Gandhiji","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fde34a4ac2d218b1a5c","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Standing at this juncture of sub-continental history, when two neighbouring countries, India and Pakistan, are looking at each other with daggers drawn, it'll be instructive to remember Jalaluddin Rumi and M K Gandhi whose birthdays fall on September 30 and October 2 respectively. Coleman Barks wrote in his book 'Rumi' that humankind is in urgent need of re-reading Gandhi and Rumi's irenic and pacifist philosophies.<br /><br />Gandhi first read Rumi at the age of 26 and his poetry, translated by the English scholar Swanton, stayed with him till his last breath. Rumi's great thought, 'Choon jang ashad ifnaaz aize khoon-e-ifraad'&nbsp; -- &lsquo;A battle is death's dance macabre&rsquo; -- moved Gandhi intensely. So too when he read Rumi's words in 'Ramz-e-Kaaynaat' &ndash; &lsquo;Passivity at any price. Suffer dishonour and disgrace but never resort to arms. Be bullied, be outraged, be killed. But do not kill'. This line is sometimes (erroneously) attributed to the Buddha.<br /><br />We indeed need to read and understand these two completely non-violent and peace-loving men who changed the way we look at conflict.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gandhi wrote to Allama Iqbal in 1930, quoting Rumi, ' Why we shed blood of our brethren for a piece of land, religion and money?' Iqbal wrote back, quoting Rumi, 'This existence of mine on earth depends upon the lives of my fellow beings. I exist because of you and vice versa.'<br /><br />The interdependence of humankind was first proclaimed by Rumi and endorsed by Gandhi. Rumi's 'Go beyond your own needs and merge yourself into the ocean of compassion' brought tears to Gandhi's eyes.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Rumi writes, 'Put your swords back in the scabbards and embrace even your enemies, for, love conquers all.' Gandhi said the same thing when he wrote to Nehru that the British must leave the country not as enemies but as friends. Such lofty philosophy is not difficult to follow, provided we elevate ourselves to higher levels.<br /><br />'Farishat boodam munhir zaat, insaan ferazat aseet ' -- Strive to become angels and spread love like fragrance&rsquo; wrote Rumi in Masnavi. We have all become too violent and blood-thirsty. The soothing philosophies of Gandhi and Rumi can uplift our souls and help make this world a place free of bloodshed and violence.<br /><br />When Maulana Abul Kalam Azad sent a sublime thought from Rumi's book, 'Parvaaz-e-ruhaniyat' (Flight of spirituality), Gandhi immediately jotted it down in his diary and called that his daily prayer. The thought was: 'The moment my sword was about to behead my &ldquo;enemy&rdquo;, it dawned on me that he was my brother and the sword fell from my hand.'<br /><br />Gandhi drew daily inspiration from the Bhagwad Gita, the 'Sermon on the Mount'&nbsp; and Rumi's 'Guldasta'. He wondered, if war-mongers like Hitler and Mussolini ever read and understood Rumi, the world would never have witnessed the two horrific World Wars and numerous other conflicts. Gandhi wrote to his Scottish friend and Christian missionary in India 'Deenbandhu' (friend of the poor) Charles Freer Andrews, ' The more I read Rumi, the more I believe in the power and capacity of human co-existence. It's a potential possibility, not a pipe-dream.' Let's rejoice in such sublime ideas of non-violence and believe that the power of love overcome violence.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally, it's an irony of fate that Rumi was born in Balkh (Afghanistan), which is today a hotbed of violence, bloodshed and cruelty. Let&rsquo;s all shun war and work for peace through love.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/rumi1475988308173.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"why we need to revisit rumi and gandhiji"},{"text":"gandhiji"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.speakingtree.in/article/why-we-need-to-revisit-rumi-and-gandhiji","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T04:45:14.786Z","udate":"2016-10-09T04:45:14.786Z","expirydate":"2016-12-31T04:45:02.164Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-06T04:44:57.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9cb5ab547d25d4f55be29","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out3645.mp3","tagsForSearch":"why we need to revisit rumi and gandhiji,gandhiji","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

India has reportedly responded with successful surgical strikes on several terror launch pads in the Pakistan-occupied <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/kashmir/\">Kashmir</a> (PoK) across the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir. The surgical strikes provided some clarity to the government&rsquo;s very muddled Pakistan policy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In between the Pakistani aggressions that India has successfully thwarted, all governments in Delhi have appeared to be at wit&rsquo;s end, blowing hot and cold&ndash; in Modi&rsquo;s case going from impromptu tea summits with the feeble Nawaz Sharif to the extremely hawkish declarations by his ministers and MPs, only to then sheath India&rsquo;s military sword. I am not suggesting there should be a perpetual all-out war between the two neighbours. But to an outside observer unsteeped in the art of double or triple speak, New Delhi&rsquo;s Kashmir policy vis-a-vis Pakistan may seem at times unclear and less than firm. Even in the aftermath of the very clear and firm surgical strikes, it remains to be seen whether the clarity and firmness continues.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Kashmir issue, thorny and complex though it is, isn&rsquo;t even the worst problem facing the country. The worst and the most intractable drag on India is the almost omnipresent corruption and near complete neglect of people&rsquo;s basic health and educational needs of most of the population in the country.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Women, young and old, continue to be raped all over the country exposing a shocking degree of brutality. From the outside looking in, it seems that the brutal but unfortunately not unique or rare case of Nirbhaya, hasn&rsquo;t shamed or deterred would be rapists among us. Just within the last few days a 12-year-old in Lucknow has been reportedly gangraped by five men while her parents were held down by some 15 others. This comes on the heels of a teen and her mother being raped in the fields surrounding a major highway in Bulandshahr near Dehli and the gangrapes of a 20-year-old woman and her 14-year-old cousin in Mewat, Haryana.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The naked and brutal dance of religious vigilantism continues to vitiate the domestic peace and harmony of the country. In its latest incarnation the Haryana Police, impotent and unable or unwilling to strike fear in the hearts of would be rapists, was busy raiding the highway eateries in Mewat &lsquo;searching&rsquo; for &lsquo;dangerous&rsquo; beef just before Eid.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the midst of it all the ruling elite noxiously trumpets the robust economic growth, its space adventures and Modi&rsquo;s thunderous speeches; and most&ndash; and I stress Most with capital M&ndash; of the population of the country continues to live in poverty&ndash;below India&rsquo;s own national poverty line. A walk around the big cities, small towns and villages quickly confirms the horrendous poverty, corruption and the political neglect. The walking and talking victims of Corruption, Hunger, Poverty and significant Lawlessness continue to haunt one long after the initial encounter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just before I left Delhi a story had broken of deaths of &lsquo;malnourished&rsquo; children in the Sheopur and other parts of Madhya Pradesh. Let&rsquo;s forget the euphemistic &ldquo;malnourishment&rdquo;. Call them hunger deaths that they are. The stories of hunger deaths abound in India. <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/google/\">Google</a> malnourishment in India and one is bombarded with story after story of the death and destruction caused by hunger and poverty. Hunger in India is worse than in the Sub-Saharan Africa. More children die of hunger in India than anywhere else, any other country in the world.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But watching, as I did, a major Delhi TV anchor solemnly declare the Sheopur hunger deaths &ldquo;an eye opener&rdquo;, you would think this was the first-ever case of malnourished, undernourished or simply hungry and bloated children dying in India. We knew the corrupted ruling classes of the Indian polity, in a never ending stupor at the switch, hadn&rsquo;t noticed or worried about it. But it was hard to believe a news anchor on a national TV network was surprised at the deaths of hungry poor children of Sheopur.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But then I should have known the impervious worlds of many journalists in the bright spanking TV studios of major TV stations, just like the worlds of many a corrupt politicians, used to their air-conditioned Mercs and Beamers surrounded by security paid for by the poverty stricken and other Indian citizens, great swaths of which continue to merely exist and subsist under the cruel world of modern day politics and officialdom in India. The impervious worlds of these politicians and journalists only collide with reality once every four or five years&ndash;at election time. In between elections many politicians and journalists act like malevolent emperors and pliant courtiers of yore. The only thing missing is the usual royal screams of &ldquo;Let them eat cake&rdquo;. And even on that score some of them do not fail to horribly shock; Raj Babbar&rsquo;s claim of a hearty meal in Mumbai costing a mere Rs 12 and Rashid Masood&rsquo;s claim of a full meal in Delhi costing Rs 5 only, in 2013, are cases in point&ndash;all in an effort to justify the then changed, completely arbitrary and pitiful poverty line.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And by the way a clinical or hospital response for the affliction of large scale hunger and poverty is nonsense. Only a wholesale change in the way the Indian ruling classes govern India can stem the grinding hunger and poverty in India. And for that to happen the ubiquitous hunger, poverty and corruption of India must make an uncomfortable presence in the imagination of all Indians all the time&ndash;not just the Indians suffering hunger and poverty; they must rise up to challenge the corrupt polity, hunger and poverty of India.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/kashmir1475988424693.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecfadba2f5892d06478e2f","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"kashmir issue is dangerous and delicate, but not the most intractable facing india"},{"text":"kashmir"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://indianexpress.com/article/blogs/kashmir-issue-is-dangerous-and-delicate-but-not-the-most-intractable-facing-india-3057393/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T04:47:11.928Z","udate":"2016-10-09T04:47:11.928Z","expirydate":"2016-12-31T04:46:12.004Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-05T04:46:06.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9cbcf339bda5d329797c5","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6241.mp3","tagsForSearch":"kashmir issue is dangerous and delicate, but not the most intractable facing india,kashmir","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

The controversy around actor Tannishtha Chatterjee&rsquo;s outburst at the &ldquo;racist attack&rdquo; on the sets of Comedy Nights Bachao, for mocking her dark skin tone, has once again put the debate out in the open.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But those reaching out for skin-lightening solutions beware -- experts warn against excessive use of such products and therapies. It can lead to life-long complications, they say.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Many creams contain steroids and they can cause permanent damage to the skin from long-term use,&rdquo; says Kuldeep Singh, Senior Consultant Plastic, Cosmetic and Reconstructed Surgery at Apollo Hospitals, New Delhi.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Healthy skin, he adds, can be achieved regardless of complexion and skin treatments cannot lead to lasting or permanent change in complexion. &ldquo;Glutathione is a drug which has been advertised all over the Internet as a skin-whitening agent. The truth is that glutathione is a very strong antioxidant present in our body which gets depleted with age or illness. The only scientifically-documented efficacy of glutathione injections is to reduce toxicity of certain anti-cancer drugs. &ldquo;The rest is all vague, and not scientifically proven,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aakriti Kochar, beauty and make-up expert at Oriflame India, points out that skin-lightening creams can only lighten the melanin in the skin to a certain extent. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t drastically change one&rsquo;s skin colour. A lot of factors, depending on the treatment and quality of one&rsquo;s skin, determine the risk factors involved in such treatments. Overdoing these can lead to severe skin problems as melanin is lightened, causing more exposure to sun rays and skin quality might be affected, leading to depleting in layers,&rdquo; Kochar says.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<section class=\"story_top_news\">\n<div class=\"news_photo\"><img src=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_800x600/HT/p2/2016/10/01/Pictures/open-skin-pores_da3984d8-87c9-11e6-ad59-fe0cd67003de.jpg\" />According to market researcher AC Nielsen, in 2010, India&rsquo;s whitening-cream market was worth $432 million (Rs 2,600 crore).

Of course, there are takers too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to market researcher AC Nielsen, in 2010, India&rsquo;s whitening-cream market was worth $432 million (Rs 2,600 crore). In 2012, Indians were said to have consumed 233 tonnes of skin-whitening products. Two years later, the obsession with &ldquo;whiteness&rdquo; scaled a new level when a brand came up with a product designed to &ldquo;brighten&rdquo; the vagina.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Blossom Kochhar, Chairperson of the Blossom Kochhar Group of Companies, agreed that even in the 21st century, there seems to be no sign of a decrease in the number of people running after fair skin. &ldquo;People do not understand that to look beautiful, you need a glowing, clear and blemish-free skin. Not necessarily fair skin, as it does not symbolise beauty,&rdquo; Kochhar, a veteran in the Indian beauty industry, said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Stressing that skin-lightening solutions do not make one&rsquo;s skin fair but merely helps in brightening the skin, she added: &ldquo;We should appreciate beautiful skin and that should not depend on the complexion. One can look beautiful by maintaining a clean and glowing skin by following a proper cleansing, toning, oiling and moisturising (CTOM) regime,&rdquo; she added.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also, the conditioning needed for people to accept and appreciate people of all skin tones must be done from childhood. &ldquo;Any bias in society exists because enough has not been done to remove it. Education should be given from childhood to sensitise everybody not to discriminate against any human being on grounds of skin colour, race, religion, nationality, gender or profession. And this should start from the parents,&rdquo; Kuldeep Singh said.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/fair1475988427216.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf27934a4ac2d218b21ca","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"grooming tips"},{"text":"make-up tips"},{"text":"skin whitening tips"},{"text":"skin whitening creams"},{"text":"spa treatments"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.hindustantimes.com/health-and-fitness/going-for-skin-lightening-whitening-solutions-rethink/story-C8nbHXCNwOBjmghgiFC4CP.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T04:47:15.043Z","udate":"2016-10-09T05:17:10.983Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T05:17:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9cbd3b547d25d4f55be2f","id":"57f9cbd3b547d25d4f55be2d","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out7185.mp3","tagsForSearch":"grooming tips,make-up tips,skin whitening tips,skin whitening creams,spa treatments","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57f9cc765c9c08595eb560df","title":"Across the thin line: Cross-LoC strikes have occurred before, owning it this time was a political call","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fde34a4ac2d218b1a5c","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With a little help from the Indian army, Prime Minister Narendra Modi picked a good window to give the green light for surgical strikes across the Line of Control in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on Wednesday night. The world has been engrossed with the UN General Assembly, America is obsessed with the tight presidential contest between Clinton and Trump and even the Chinese are warily waiting and watching how the latest escalation between the two south Asian nuclear powers will manifest itself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It seems as if the Americans had indicated to Delhi, in the wake of the Uri attack, that if the Indian side carried out a covert strike and took out a few people, it would look the other way. It is more than likely that US national security adviser Susan Rice exchanged notes about the strikes with her counterpart, Ajit Doval, when they spoke over the phone on Wednesday.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Delhi put out a laudatory press release, highlighting the fact that Rice had condemned the &ldquo;cross-border attack&rdquo;. Earlier statements by the US state department had only condemned the terrorist act itself, with no pointer to Pakistan. With memories of Operation Geronimo still fresh, when the US sent planes under the cover of night to take out Osama bin Laden from Abbottabad five years ago, Rice couldn&rsquo;t but have grudgingly accepted that Doval could take a leaf out of America&rsquo;s book.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What the world simply doesn&rsquo;t want to see is war, especially not between two nuclear states and definitely not when the risk of a nuclear accident is at stake. Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif&rsquo;s irresponsible statements about not hesitating to use nuclear weapons is a clear case of nuclear blackmail. The Chinese may try and smother this unnecessary irritation and the Americans may hope Asif doesn&rsquo;t mean what he says &ndash; or more importantly, doesn&rsquo;t say what he doesn&rsquo;t mean.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If Modi wanted to avenge the Uri attack, the Americans are believed to have said, he would need to do it skilfully so it didn&rsquo;t invite Pakistani retaliation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As it turns out, the Pakistanis are even denying that surgical strikes have taken place inside its territory along the LoC. The Pakistan army&rsquo;s media cell has admitted to two soldiers being killed, but that&rsquo;s all. That&rsquo;s probably best, at least for the time being, as anger levels in Rawalpindi are kept down, thereby ruling out retaliatory measures.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just as the narrative inside Pakistan, after Uri, blamed Indians for carrying out the attack against their own soldiers at the army base, accounts from inside Pakistan say the cross-LoC strikes were only small arms fire from the Indian side.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Certainly, the Pakistan army&rsquo;s capacity to throw wool in the eyes of its own people has been notable since 1947 &ndash; then, the soldiers were called &ldquo;raiders&rdquo;, until that deceit was exposed by none other than the people of Jammu &amp; Kashmir who repulsed them. And in 1999, Pakistan&rsquo;s Northern Light Infantry dressed themselves up in civilian clothes when they first invaded India at Kargil.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The prime minister&rsquo;s strategists effectively used the media to send some messages to Pakistan. And so an array of options were discussed &ndash; from abrogating the Indus Waters Treaty to withdrawing most favoured nation status for Pakistan, to telling Pakistani artistes and musicians to exit India.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It could be that this was only a feint, a master cover-up, never intended for implementation; although some of these measures remain on the table. But as he spoke to the people of Pakistan, from a party pulpit in Kerala, asking them to rise up against their own establishment &ndash; meaning, the Pakistan army, the centre of gravity inside Pakistan &ndash; the PM realised he had to distinguish between the two.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cancelling India&rsquo;s participation at the Saarc summit and masterminding the absence of three other countries, was the first step. Striking terror launching pads &ndash; and killing a Pakistani soldier or two &ndash; was in line with Modi&rsquo;s newfound strategy, that the Pakistan army, which is hand in glove with an anti-India army of terrorists it has raised, had to be taught a lesson.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">None other than former army chief, Gen Bikram Singh, has come on record to say that such strikes by Indian soldiers have taken place in the past as well, including in the wake of the decapitation of two Indian soldiers in January 2013 when Manmohan Singh&rsquo;s UPA was in power. Interestingly the strikes have only been mounted across the LoC, never across the international boundary.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The difference, this time, is that Modi made a political call to own the cross-LoC strikes. In 2013, no one knew that such a strike had even taken place.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Still, the truth is that the Pakistan army isn&rsquo;t about to give up training, arming and transforming poor Pakistani boys into terrorists and sending them into India to create mayhem. The prime minister must know that. That is why the army has to stay alert, especially in the coming days.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But the prime minister must also know that for the army to be successful it must be backed not only by the political class, but also by the popular people&rsquo;s will. If only for that reason, the PM must implement measures for reconciliation in Kashmir. Travelling to Srinagar, after Modi has shown Pakistan that it cannot be business as usual, could be the opening that Kashmir needs to turn a new page.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"italic\">The writer is a politcal commentator</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"italic\">- Jyoti Malhotra</span></p>","publishersId":"57baa979cabe7a5704419047","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"across the thin line: cross-loc strikes have occurred before, owning it this time was a political call"}],"langIdentifier":"en","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/ist/across-the-thin-line-cross-loc-strikes-have-occurred-before-owning-it-this-time-was-a-political-call/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T04:49:58.661Z","udate":"2016-10-09T04:49:58.661Z","expirydate":"2016-12-31T04:49:35.230Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-05T04:49:30.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","title_or_id":"Across the thin line: Cross-LoC strikes have occurred before, owning it this time was a political call","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9cc765c9c08595eb560e1","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out5403.mp3","tagsForSearch":"across the thin line: cross-loc strikes have occurred before, owning it this time was a political call","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57f9cccc339bda5d329797d2","title":"The Lady Vanquishes","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fde34a4ac2d218b1a5c","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">TO READ ABOUT Jayalalithaa&rsquo;s life is to enter the psyche of a woman who declares war in a field where men dominate and make the rules. Most observers would credit her political success against such odds to sheer ambition, a word that grows heavier with judgement when ascribed to a woman. Vaasanthi dumps this cookie-cutter analysis of women achievers and brings her protagonist alive in <em>Amma: Jayalalithaa&rsquo;s Journey from Movie Star to Political Queen</em>. In trying to unpeel the layers of the enigmatic leader of Tamil Nadu, Vaasanthi reveals a complex person who is motivated in equal parts by intellectual pursuit, love, competition, identity politics, vengeance, and indeed, a particularly female defiance born in response to relentless male aggression.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a journalist, Vaasanthi first met Jayalalithaa in New Delhi in 1984, when the latter was a parliamentarian in the Rajya Sabha. She had her own tape recorder, and bristled at direct questions. She later called Vaasanthi on the phone to add a line with the stern order: &ldquo;Just write as I tell you.&rdquo; It serves as a portent of her infamous hostility to the media.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The book is rich with such anecdotes, collected through interviews with two of Jayalalithaa&rsquo;s school friends, her Public Relations Officer &lsquo;Film News&rsquo; Anandan (she was the first actor to appoint one on a regular salary), her speech writer Solai, and Vaasanthi&rsquo;s own reportage as the editor of <em>India Today</em>&rsquo;s Tamil edition for 10 years from 1993. It also draws a perspective from Jayalalithaa&rsquo;s own unusually open memoir serialised in the journal <em>Kumudam</em>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Amma</em> begins in the sepia-tinted world of Ammu, the academically gifted, well-mannered Iyengar Brahmin girl who lost her father at two. Growing up in Bangalore and Madras, she was desperate for her actor mother&rsquo;s attention. But when Ammu became a beautiful 16-year- old, she bent to her financially strapped mother&rsquo;s requests, gave up a state scholarship and became an actor herself. Films themselves were easy &mdash;Jayalalithaa was spunky, beautiful, and talented. &ldquo;There was no intermediate or struggling period for me,&rdquo; she says in an interview. &ldquo;Overnight I was famous and fabulously successful.&rdquo; But privileged, precocious and upper-caste as she was, she balked at the hierarchies in the film industry, committing such grave transgressions as sitting with her legs crossed, reading a book as a senior actor entered the studio. Come matinee idol MG Ramachandran (MGR), though, everything changed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here the rigorously researched book shines with empathy and remarkable insight. From the description of the nervousness of a 17-year-old acting her first ever scene&mdash;a wedding night&mdash; with MGR, 35 years her senior, to his overbearing and jealous control over her film career; from her pestering him to marry her, his irresponsible promise that he later reneged on, to Jayalalithaa&rsquo;s grovelling love letter that was leaked, Vaasanthi teases out the dynamics of a consensual but tumultuous relationship that was never quite equal.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">MGR was initially in the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), and later split it to form what is now the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). As he became busy with politics, Jayalalithaa was finally free to work with other top actors, and do as she wished. By 1973, they had parted, and she pursued a serious relationship with Telugu actor Shoban Babu, younger than MGR. This relationship ended soon, partly because Babu was married. Broken and humiliated, she took a hiatus for a few years, and finally had little option but to rejoin her mentor. Vaasanthi tries to explore this return, and the inevitable shift to politics. She writes briefly&mdash; too briefly&mdash;about Jayalalithaa&rsquo;s coincidental meeting with MGR in the United States and &lsquo;a change of heart&rsquo; that brought the protagonist back into the limelight, this time, through politics.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Apart from MGR, only Jayalalithaa&mdash; with her closeness to him&mdash;seemed to spin magic for the AIADMK in election rallies. MGR needed her oratory and organisational skills, but he also feared being taken for granted. He makes her propaganda secretary, she makes a misstep, he fires her, she wins his trust back, he then reinstates her. This pattern repeats itself. In a personal letter that was leaked, Jayalalithaa writes: &lsquo;Please don&rsquo;t be angry with me. Who else is there for me? Where will I go leaving you? Am I not your own Ammu?&rsquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The popular narrative of Jayalalithaa&rsquo;s rise in Tamil cinema and politics portrays her as a temptress. RM Veerappan, MGR&rsquo;s close aide&mdash;whom Vaasanthi calls &lsquo;a snake in the grass&rsquo;&mdash;considered the young woman a &lsquo;manipulator and oppressor&rsquo;. Fascinatingly, the voters seemed less morally judgemental of Jayalalithaa. She was called &lsquo;anni&rsquo;, or brother&rsquo;s wife&mdash;a moniker she embraced openly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After MGR&rsquo;s death, however, her colleagues began to openly humiliate her. At 38, &lsquo;she, who had been looked upon by the party cadres as a natural successor to their beloved leader, was now a non-entity, fighting to have a glimpse of the departed leader&rsquo;. She accused MGR&rsquo;s wife Janaki of poisoning him, provoking a protective rage from the men in the AIADMK. Jayalalithaa could have lost her political career over this personal battle. But she used her popularity to claw her way back to the top.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To convince the polity that she was MGR&rsquo;s chosen one, Jayalalithaa often narrated an incident. When she was planning to leave political life, she said, MGR had placed her palm on the picture of his mother, forcing her to take a vow not to quit politics. Her chief in-party opponent RM Veerappan, Vaasanthi writes, insists that the incident was made up. But this was Jayalalithaa&rsquo;s way of appropriating MGR&rsquo;s legacy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">THROUGH IT ALL, the DMK kept up its perverse, sexist attacks that turned physical more than once. Many of these&mdash;the tearing of her sari in the state legislature, the slap by Janaki&rsquo;s nephew, the shaming and abuse&mdash;are well-worn stories. Vaasanthi refreshes this otherwise sordid history by dropping the sensational gaze, reminding us how vicious Tamil Nadu politics used to be, and how tremendous Jayalalithaa&rsquo;s stubborn fight was. It also explains why she grew more reserved, more hateful of the media, and so untrusting of colleagues that she &lsquo;was fast losing sight of the ground beneath her feet&rsquo;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even as the book offers a rare gendered appreciation of Jayalalithaa as a mass leader, it critiques her terrible excesses as Chief Minister. Her vindictive competition with DMK&rsquo;s Karunanidhi fuelled overnight transfers of administrators and policy reversals, and the frail old man&rsquo;s violent arrest at 2 am remains etched in collective memory. Intolerant of any dissent, she allegedly had bureaucrats attacked with acid, had presses ransacked, filed hundreds of defamation suits against journalists, and ended the career of party members at the drop of a &lsquo;but&rsquo;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By this time, Jayalalithaa had become Amma, the AIADMK supremo, an icon to be deified and feared. The section that charts this political transformation is a thrilling pr&eacute;cis of her dramatic actions. But it does not have the interiority Vaasanthi manages in the personal history through creative and astute storytelling. Amma is a tough assignment today: she does not meet the media, colleagues and friends like Sasikala (&lsquo;the woman who knew too much&rsquo;) rarely speak, and legislators are mere placeholders as her administrative decisions are single-minded decrees. Still, few journalists know the leader like Vaasanthi does, and one wishes she had analysed what drives Amma&rsquo;s policy efficiency, why she adopted Sasikala&rsquo;s nephew, how this devout Brahmin imbibed Dravidian politics, or what makes her incapable of delegating work. The primary threats to her career in the past decade of the DMK&rsquo;s decline have been her many corruption cases. How she has overcome them is worth investigating, but the book simply shows the protagonist turning to superstitious prayers or being surprised.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Behind Jayalalithaa&rsquo;s seemingly bulletproof persona today, though, echoes of her past vulnerability occasionally ring out. Earlier this year, when a BJP member made an obscene comment about BSP leader Mayawati, Jayalalithaa, just elected Chief Minister for a historic second consecutive term, issued a strong statement. Pointing out that she herself had been at the receiving end of such attacks, she wrote: &lsquo;My heart goes out to Ms Mayawati&rsquo;. In many ways, Jayalalithaa&rsquo;s travails and connected autocratic tendencies resemble that of other successful Indian women leaders: Mamata Banerjee, Mayawati and Sonia Gandhi. The harder they have had to fight, the fewer the people they allow into their inner circle, the less we know about them today.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Amma</em>&rsquo;s strength lies in tracing the beginnings of a leader that few understand or have access to. The book is unfazed by the enigma, and sees a gutsy woman, a flawed politician, a conscious mass leader who lived through tectonic shifts in Tamil Nadu politics. Its fable-like narrative reveals the breakthroughs possible even in the ugliness of Indian politics.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Liberating Jayalalithaa from the image trap</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Amma: Jayalalithaa&rsquo;s Journey From Movie Star to Political Queen | Vaasanthi | Juggernaut | 175 Pages | Rs 299</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/amma1475988677498.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"the lady vanquishes"},{"text":"amma"},{"text":"jayalalitha"},{"text":"tamilnadu cm"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/books/the-lady-vanquishes","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T04:51:24.122Z","udate":"2016-10-09T04:51:24.122Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T04:51:24.122Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T04:51:18.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9cccc339bda5d329797d4","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out9935.mp3","tagsForSearch":"the lady vanquishes,amma,jayalalitha,tamilnadu cm","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Muscles responsible for metatarsophalangeal joint motions may therefore be strengthened with this type of landing.</p>\n</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/run1475988719809.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf27934a4ac2d218b21ca","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"running"},{"text":"exercise"},{"text":"workout"},{"text":"muscles"},{"text":"physical activity"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.hindustantimes.com/health-and-fitness/run-in-minimalist-shoes-to-increase-leg-foot-muscles-volume/story-goThfEH9sFXYMjokPs8NyJ.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T04:52:08.056Z","udate":"2016-10-09T05:17:10.983Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T05:17:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9ccf8b547d25d4f55be40","id":"57f9ccf8b547d25d4f55be3e","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out3524.mp3","tagsForSearch":"running,exercise,workout,muscles,physical activity","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

In the wee hours of the morning after, they were picked up from there by police personnel and shot dead, allegedly, in cold blood.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is a story that has often repeated itself through India&rsquo;s so-called red corridor, especially in the Bastar region: innocent people picked up and shot dead in the name of anti-Maoist operations.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I specifically mention Bastar because there appears to be some sort of incentivisation in Chhattisgarh to boost the kill count. It is nauseating to see journalists close to a certain police officer eulogising him for such sinister operations, referring to him as &ldquo;tiger&rdquo; and using every possible emoji on WhatsApp groups to lionise him.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The academic Nandini Sundar, who has for long dealt with violence in Bastar, begins her book, The Burning Forest: India&rsquo;s war in Bastar, with a similar incident in February 2006, when a group of security forces, led by vigilantes of Salwa Judum, swooped down on a village in Bastar, raping and killing a young woman, Jogi, who had just returned home after collecting mahua flowers. To draw home the message that nothing has changed even 10 years later, Sundar describes another incident from February this year when two boys were picked up from a forest and then killed, like the two boys I mentioned in the beginning. The similarity is shocking; but more shocking is the fact that no heads will roll in these cases or dozens of such others.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is largely because of Sundar&rsquo;s efforts that the Supreme Court&rsquo;s intervention in Salwa Judum became possible. Unlike most journalists or even activists, Sundar is invested in the people of Bastar. Her investment is reflected in the clarity of her narrative about how the lives of adivasis have been destroyed by the state that has enabled a very convenient marriage of mining and militarism. She writes that she went to Bastar for the first time in 1990 as a Ph.D. student, a time when she &ldquo;laughed a lot.&rdquo; By that time, the first squads of Maoist guerrillas had been in Bastar for 10 years and, barring an odd newspaper report or two, there were very little signs of the war. But the war had already begun, as she realised soon afterwards.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like most of those who have tried to make sense of the war in Bastar, Sundar also grapples with the question of where to begin the narrative &mdash; should it begin with the adivasis of Bastar rebelling against the British more than a hundred years ago, or 1947 when India became independent, or 1967 when the Spring Thunder of revolution erupted in far-off Naxalbari, or in 1980 when the Maoist guerillas entered Bastar for the first time, or in 2004 when their war against the state intensified, prompting then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to call it &ldquo;India&rsquo;s biggest internal security threat&rdquo;?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"custom-caption\"><img class=\"wp-image-3059535 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/10/the-burning-forest.jpg\" alt=\"the-burning-forest\" />There are enough questions that have been answered in The Burning Forest to keep you sleepless over several nights.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sundar insists that her narrative is not about the Maoists but about Indian democracy and how it has reduced &ldquo;political contests over rights, distributive justice and alternative visions of the good to law and order problems.&rdquo; The picture she paints is grim, but mostly familiar to those who follow the war in Bastar (and elsewhere in the red corridor): a local media intimidated or co-opted by the state, indifference of the national media, the loot of the region&rsquo;s natural resources and the cosy relationship between the Maoists and industrialists, how the Maoists entrenched themselves among the adivasis (especially Gonds), how the Maoists are seen as &ldquo;national vermin&rdquo; to be fought by state forces with names such as Greyhounds and Cobras, or how the security forces have penetrated deep into the erstwhile Maoist bastions, sometimes demolishing memorials erected in memory of fallen Maoist leaders such as the one on the river launch of Janbai (not Jambai) in Odisha&rsquo;s Malkangiri for Patel Sudhakar Reddy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From Part Two, titled &lsquo;Civil War&rsquo;, the narrative focuses on the phenomenon of Salwa Judum, showing how quickly it spread within one year (from its inception in 2005), turning village after village into battle zones and ending up strengthening the Maoists. It is a stark reminder of the follies committed by the state and a damning indictment of how the state turned adivasis against each other, with many days turning into &ldquo;absolute carnivals of looting, arson, rape and killing.&rdquo; The author deftly weaves stories of how the Judum triggered off a cycle of violence and displacement, reducing people to &ldquo;both anger and helpless, vacant despair.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the third and final part of the book, Sundar looks at how the state and its policies and plans and legislations have failed to bring about any significant change in the lives of the people in this war zone. A majority of funds allotted to bring development to 88 Maoist-affected districts, have been used to construct roads (for the easy movement of troops), while people suffer from an absolute lack of basic amenities like healthcare and education. Sundar also correctly points out the fallacy of &ldquo;celebrity campaigns&rdquo;, which make Soni Sori the face of the fight against Salwa Judum while activists like Manish Kunjam (of the Communist Party of India) remain mostly obscure. In village after village in Bastar (Sarkeguda, for example), if you care to visit, they will tell you how Kunjam silently appeared with a tractor (at Bhadrachalam in Telangana where they had migrated because of Judum terror) and without any fanfare brought them back to their land.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The author likes to make a virtue out of the fact that she has never been embedded with the Maoists. &ldquo;I was told it was because I ask too many questions,&rdquo; she writes. But sometimes there is no need to ask questions. The answers are right there and Sundar is not incapable of finding them. Nevertheless, there are enough questions that have been answered in The Burning Forest to keep you sleepless over several nights, thinking about what we have done to our own people. It is a book that all of us need to read.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rahul Pandita is the author of, among others, Hello, Bastar: The untold story of India&rsquo;s Maoist movement.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/fire1475988770227.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecfadba2f5892d06478e2f","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"they didn’t start the fire"},{"text":"burning forest"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/books/the-burning-forest-indias-war-in-bastar-maoist-nandini-sundar-3058758/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T04:52:56.828Z","udate":"2016-10-09T04:52:56.828Z","expirydate":"2016-12-31T04:52:08.980Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-04T04:52:05.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9cd28b547d25d4f55be48","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out3257.mp3","tagsForSearch":"they didn’t start the fire,burning forest","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Whilst this has been observed in clinical settings, the cause of this was previously unclear.\"<br /><br />\"Our findings suggest that the cause could be linked to the length of telomeres which appears to be different in acne sufferers and means their cells may be protected against ageing,\" he added.<br /><br />Telomeres are DNA-protecting structures at the ends of our chromosomes.<br /><br />Think of them like those little plastic caps that sit on the ends of your shoelaces to keep them from fraying.<br /><br />Each time a cell divides, its telomeres get shorter, to the point where the cell can't replicate anymore.<br /><br />A cell that can't replicate anymore either dies or becomes senescent, which means it can no longer grow or function properly.<br /><br />This telomere shortening process has been associated with ageing, cancer, and a higher risk of death.<br /><br />Those who produce higher levels of an enzyme called telomerase will experience slower cell death and senescence, because it helps rebuild the length of telomeres after cell division.<br /><br />That means they'll show less outwardly visible signs of progressive cell death, such as wrinkles and thinning skin.<br /><br />If that telomerase sounds like something we should be bottling and bathing in, don't worry, scientists are working on it.<br /><br />The problem with trying to bottle telomerase is that one of life's big mysteries is why only certain cells produce the enzyme, and why certain people tend to produce more of it than others.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It's been shown that things like smoking and obesity can rapidly accelerate the telomere shortening process, which is why smokers or those who are heavily overweight tend to look older than they actually are.</p>\n<div class=\"last6brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The results have been published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology.&nbsp;</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/acne1475989349976.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf24aea63af2cd0d81ce6","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"acne infection"},{"text":"telomeres"},{"text":"dermatologists"},{"text":"obesity"},{"text":"dermatology"},{"text":"journal of investigative dermatology"},{"text":"chromosomes"},{"text":"simone ribero"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/People-with-acne-are-protected-against-aging-Study/articleshow/54627978.cms","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T05:02:38.274Z","udate":"2016-10-09T05:17:10.983Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T05:17:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9cf6ef6280d58e8c2c163","id":"57f9cf6ef6280d58e8c2c161","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out9131.mp3","tagsForSearch":"acne infection,telomeres,dermatologists,obesity,dermatology,journal of investigative dermatology,chromosomes,simone ribero","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Starting something is hard on your spouse or family because it involves sacrificing time spent together. It has been a learning curve for me. Recently, I have started setting some rules &ndash; like keeping weekends free just for my family, taking a quick road trip to switch-off. Evenings, at home, are about grabbing some comfort food with Sapna, my wife, and catching up a few shows on Netflix. I envy people who efficiently manage time, stress and their schedules in a way that they are able to take time off and travel. It&rsquo;s a mindset. I&rsquo;m trying to achieve that. Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll get there!<br /><br /><strong>Being a fit man</strong><br /><br />About a year ago, I bought some basic equipment and set up a small gym at home. I have a trainer who comes in early morning, 3-4 times a week, and helps me in strength and functional training. Being disciplined about fitness is hard, but I&rsquo;ve done it for a year now. So I&rsquo;m happy about that!<br /><br /><strong>Energy high and happiness</strong><br /><br />My wife is a big dog lover. Two years ago, she adopted two pups. Their energy and excitement, after a long, hard day is sheer joy. Waking up each day to work on something is naturally exhilarating. To add to that, when you reach work to meet a driven young team working hard to solve problems and grow as professionals, it gives you an adrenaline boost.<br /><br /><strong>Spiritual diet</strong><br /><br />I&rsquo;m not a spiritual man. More than spirituality, it is more fulfilling to be able to do something for someone who does not have the means and opportunities.<br /><br /><strong>Risk-taker or a micro-planner</strong><br /><br />A risk-taker &ndash; every entrepreneur has to be one. You have to trust your gut. Once you get a direction, you sit with the team to plan and execute. A shift in strategy or a bold move when the chips are down drives an entrepreneur.<br /><br /><strong>Handling failure/success</strong><br /><br />You can&rsquo;t shy away from failures and work at a startup. There have been moments (and I&rsquo;m sure there will be more) when you feel that the walls are closing in on you. But one thing I have realised is that there is always a way out.<br /><br /><strong>Managing Crisis</strong><br /><br />In a crisis, I like to take control. Someone has to call the shots in such situations. Right or wrong, you have to take decisions. I believe that a leader of a business has to instill the spirit of &lsquo;we can do it&rsquo; and take the responsibility for that decision.<br />When the morale is low, rallying your team is the way to go. You can&rsquo;t find fault with people/processes at that point. Introspection and course correction come later.<br /><br /><strong>The song I like to hum</strong><br /><br />Pink Floyd&rsquo;s Wish You Were Here</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /><strong>A book that means a lot to me</strong></p>\n<div class=\"last7brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Open by <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Andre-Agassi\">Andre Agassi</a> and The Big Short by Michael Lewis</div>\n<div class=\"last5brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /><strong>A movie that moved me</strong></div>\n<div class=\"last3brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />The Pursuit of Happyness</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/recharge1475989648055.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf4dbea63af2cd0d81d05","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"fit"},{"text":"energy"},{"text":"gym"},{"text":"diet"},{"text":"micro-planner"},{"text":"andre agassi"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/de-stress/Quick-road-trips-help-me-recharge/articleshow/54624689.cms","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T05:07:36.357Z","udate":"2016-10-09T05:17:10.983Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T05:17:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9d098f2efff597a3969ba","id":"57f9d098f2efff597a3969b8","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out5193.mp3","tagsForSearch":"fit,energy,gym,diet,micro-planner,andre agassi","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

For decades, this time of the season had been setting the festooned median along the Vazhuthacaud- Vellayamabalam stretch in &lsquo;full bloom&rsquo;, a picture that tugs at the heartstrings of most capital natives at the start of Soorya Festival.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At its 40th birthday, Soorya Festival, without question, is one of the best and most sought-after cultural spectacle India can boast of. If the culturati looks to this modest South Indian city now, none better than Soorya Krishnamoorthy is worth the credit. No wonder if Wikipedia acknowledges this man for placing the city onto the &lsquo;cultural and film map of India&rsquo;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From a 21-day cultural extravaganza restricted to a single venue, it grew into an annual event of 50 to 75 days duration and Soorya Fest happens now all year round somewhere in the world with its roots spread out to 38 countries. In Kerala, curtains just went up for the 111-day jamboree beginning with the Soorya Film Festival.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It&rsquo;s a given that the fest is announced on the first day of a fresh financial year &mdash; April 1st &mdash; and preparations start from the very next day of Ganesh Chathurthi every year so that the fest starts rolling on September 21. This has been a code Krishnamoorthy has set and follows without fail.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The fest though has outgrown its humble venue &mdash; Tagore theatre &mdash; Soorya Stage and Film Society is proudly hosting the fest for the first time in town stage, the Ganesham open air theatre in Thycaud &mdash; one of the several venues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;The current tariff is not affordable for a cultural society of our stature to hire Tagore theatre. This shouldn't be the scene. Actually the sum has to be rationalised for every artiste's sake. Else, we need to find huge sponsorship to spend money for this stage. Our theory is to pick the most cheaply accessible venue to accommodate maximum audience to watch our programmes. Only if there are larger venues could we accommodate all who have taken a membership with the society,&rdquo; says Krishnamoorthy. The chain of tradition&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; remained unbroken at this fete with Soorya&rsquo;s grand opening ceremony taking place at Tagore theatre.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;We began with invoking Lord Ganesha and the culmination is to be marked with a stage show dedicated to Jesus Christ. That itself is sending out a message of communal harmony,&rdquo;&nbsp; says Krishnamoorthy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Ganesham theatre is set to host the special six-day Ramayana series in December. A 30 trained dancers&rsquo; team from Kalakshethra are coming down to present the six kandas of Ramayana in these days.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The 40th year fete&rsquo;s highlight event is an international painting exhibition with the participation of 40 painters from across the world. A 10-day &lsquo;arangu&rsquo; series is another specialty.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What&rsquo;s it that Krishnamoorthy would like to call the milestone in the four-decade history? The awards and honours? Wide-mouthed publicity? Big headlines? Not any of these. He would attribute the success to &ldquo;the emergence of some new artistes is the achievement of each fest.&rdquo; &ldquo;Soorya Fest has been a turning point&nbsp; for several artistes and some of whom have acknowledged it in public. Especially for youngsters, the fest it is a jumpstart.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Every year and this time too, singer K.J. Yesudas&rsquo;s concert is on October 1. Other two regular faces, dancer/actor Shobhana and classical danseuse Padma Subramaniam won&rsquo;t make it to the fest in the current edition. Shobhana has the record of dancing for 25 long years and Padma has been a constant presence for 39 editions. Soorya Fest walked into the Limca Book of Records for the longest and largest festival of Asia the time when it was expanded to a 75-day programme.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What does he look forward to? &ldquo;The popularity of the fest must be retained. We have no VIP reservation or long-winding speeches at the start of our programmes. Artistes are our guests. We keep no office or paid staff. Everyone functions without any profit intent. My prayer is to maintain this style when Soorya festival runs into 50 years, 100 years or more,&rdquo; Krishnamoorthy ruminates on the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/cultural1475990063075.jpeg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baab806a12cf7ee39133b8","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"dawn of cultural spring"},{"text":"cultural spring"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/books-and-art/290916/dawn-of-cultural-spring.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T05:14:30.382Z","udate":"2016-10-09T05:14:30.382Z","expirydate":"2016-12-31T05:14:03.660Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-05T05:13:59.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9d236339bda5d3297985c","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out4256.mp3","tagsForSearch":"dawn of cultural spring,cultural spring","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

But with the price of apples skyrocketing, it has indeed become much more expensive to have a daily apple than to visit the doctor occasionally. With the trusty old apple biting the bullet, people have started looking for new methods to keep ill health at bay and have zeroed in on daily exercise as a sure shot means of maintaining good health.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Good-dietary-habits\">Good dietary habits</a> and daily adequate exercise have long been recognized as being essential for the prevention and management of <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Diabetes\">diabetes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.speakingtree.in/topics/health/obesity\">obesity</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/hypertension\">hypertension</a>. However, with rapidly changing lifestyles and the time stress of urban living, allocation of one hour for exercise daily has long been relegated to the sidelines.<br /><br />Recent studies have identified that on any given day, an average person&rsquo;s schedule included about 8 hours of sitting, driving to work, sitting in an office, driving home, and watching TV. An international study recently published in Lancet that involved over 1 million people revealed that 1 hour of moderate physical activity could eliminate most of the health risks associated with sedentary behaviour.<br /><br />The study forms the first part of a four-paper series published by The Lancet that provides an overview and update of worldwide trends of physical activity and the global impact of physical inactivity.<br /><br />The study also said that &ndash; &ldquo;People who had the greatest risk of death were those individuals who sat for prolonged periods and were mostly inactive. They were between the 28-59 percent more likely to die early, compared with those in the most active group, which is a risk similar to that associated with smoking and obesity&rdquo;.<br />The <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/World-Health-Organization\">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) recommends that adults aged 18-64 should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week. But this is the bare minimum and any improvement over these 150 minutes can only be a welcome addition.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Exercise and an active lifestyle has a major positive impact on the control of blood glucose levels and also the long term outcomes of people with diabetes across all ages. However, people need to understand that exercise not only means aerobic exercises (cardio) but also resistance exercises like push-ups and weight training at least twice a week, that builds up the endurance of large muscle groups.</p>\n<div class=\"last6brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The advent of the digital era has led to a massive upsurge in sedentary lifestyles, leading to a rapid growth of preventable conditions like obesity, diabetes and hypertension.

{"_id":"57f9d28cf807295d859fe6ec","title":"Writing a new play? The Shankar Shesh Foundation can help you produce it","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a teenager, Sanjay Shesh (now 54) often accompanied his playwright father Dr Shankar Shesh to Hindi and Marathi dramas. He didn&rsquo;t want to write plays, or even act in them. But he liked accompanying his father. Their family moved from Bilaspur (Chhattisgarh) to Mumbai in the &rsquo;70s because Shesh, inspired by theatre director Satyadev Dubey, wanted to devote his life to theatre. From 1969 to 1981, the author penned 22 Hindi plays, including some popular ones such as Ek Aur Dronacharya, Poster and Bin Baati Ke Deep. Now, 35 years after his father passed away, Sanjay is launching a literary initiative &mdash; the Shankar Shesh Foundation &mdash; to honour Shesh&rsquo;s work. Two plays, Komal Gandhar and Raktbeej, will be performed at the NCPA on October 2, which is Dr Shesh&rsquo;s birthday. We talk to Sanjay about the enterprise as he reminisces about his father&rsquo;s career, and what inspired him to write.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How has your father&rsquo;s involvement in theatre influenced your family?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My father pursued the arts all his life. All his sons pursued engineering. We were exposed to theatre because it was written at our house, and we had people of [literary] repute visiting us. So, while theatre wasn&rsquo;t our primary interest, we were introduced to art and culture at home. I wouldn&rsquo;t say we were keen theatregoers, but we weren&rsquo;t averse to it as well.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/jDRsYzF.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>The late Hindi playwright Shankar Shesh.</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What led you to launch the foundation now?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our father hasn&rsquo;t been with us since 1981. But my mother, Sudha Shesh, was there. She would give permission to those who approached her to stage his plays. But things were not organised. Like my father, she was always willing to let people perform his works. We never thought about royalties. Even today, we don&rsquo;t think about it. When my mother came to live with us in Mumbai, a group took her consent to perform one of my father&rsquo;s plays in July 2015. I accidentally happened to watch that play in Marathi. I was so impressed and enjoyed it so much that I felt I should do something about his plays. Unfortunately, we lost our mother soon after that. When she passed away, I thought I should do something for both of them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What is the societal and political context of your father&rsquo;s plays? What real experiences inspired him to write them?</strong></p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He was associated with education. While working as a Hindi professor in Nagpur, he wrote Ek Aur Dronacharya, which has been performed more than 100 times. He wrote plays that spoke about the political environment of education in India. After his stint with education, he became part of tribal welfare. There, he was introduced to casteism in India, which inspired him to he come up with stories like Bad Ka Pani and Poster, which was based on Bastar (a tribal area in Chhattisgarh). He travelled a lot in Bastar.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"story_top_news\">\n<div class=\"news_photo\"><img src=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_800x600/HT/p2/2016/09/25/Pictures/_b912929a-8314-11e6-a0d9-e435f3f63e15.jpg\" /></div>\n<h2>Shankar Shesh at work.</h2>\n</section>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>He also wrote scripts for movies&hellip;</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After he moved to Mumbai, he wrote the story of Gharaonda (1977). He realised that you have to struggle in the city to have a house of your own. The film is about that. Then, when he saw that many of his friends were getting divorced, he wrote Dooriyan (1979). He also wrote the dialogues for Sridevi&rsquo;s first movie &mdash; Solva Sawan (1979). It also featured Amol Palekar.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Do you feel Shankar Shesh&rsquo;s work hasn&rsquo;t received enough recognition?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My father wrote plays prior to 1981. He was writing Hindi plays in a city where art and culture that was predominantly Maharashtrian. The people working with Hindi theatre were living in Delhi and Lucknow, and they thought that since Dr Shesh was living in Mumbai, he was writing for films. So, I think I should get him the recognition, which I don&rsquo;t think he received [in his lifetime].</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_800x600/HT/p2/2016/09/25/Pictures/_ded701e6-8314-11e6-a0d9-e435f3f63e15.jpg\" /></p>\n<section class=\"story_top_news\">\n<h2>Shankar Shesh receives his PhD degree from Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit .</h2>\n</section>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What do you hope to achieve with the foundation?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The idea is to create an institution around his work. If a youngster wants to write, he or she can use this platform, and write a play for the Shankar Shesh Foundation. Today, it&rsquo;s difficult to find someone who has a good idea, a good script, and also good dialogue-writing skills. For example, we want to get 10 people &mdash; one person with the idea, another to write the script, and a third to write dialogues, and so on. Together, we would create new scripts, plays, stories and poems. The idea is to encourage new writers.

He has been busy meeting artists from across the globe and comprehending their works for the past 14 months. And Sudarshan likes to put that journey down as an enriching experience. &ldquo;It was good. We had a great time doing it so far,&rdquo; says the curator.&nbsp;&nbsp; The upcoming Biennale will have participants converging at Kochi from different places, including Europe, America and Japan.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;We have artists coming from places like Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey. It is not that I travelled to every place to interact with the artists; I have also met a few of artists online,&rdquo; says Shetty, who believes that the entire journey has been quite rewarding. &ldquo;I got to meet many artists and delve deep into their works. Raul Zurita was the first artist declared for the Biennale. We invited him to Kerala as the first step. That triggered a chain of events that led me to other artists. The process took more than one year; we are almost at the end of it now,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n<p class=\"imgCenter\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a class=\"objectNew\"><img title=\"Snapshots from the previous editions of Biennale\" src=\"http://dc-cdn.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/48f0e5e1fc0bb3900415a78ef14c4f9bd2552ab0-tc-img-preview.jpg\" alt=\"Snapshots from the previous editions of Biennale\" /></a><span class=\"embcaption\">Snapshots from the previous editions of Biennale&nbsp;</span>According to Sudarshan, it is too early to announce the exact number of participants as the finalising process is still going on. However, he assures that there would be around 90 artists for the event. Compared to the previous two editions, the third one will see talents from different fields coming under one roof. &ldquo;It would be a melange of talents. There would be dancers, theatre personalities and writers alongside those who follow conventional practices such as painting and sculpting,&rdquo; says Sudarshan. Was it a conscious decision? &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class=\"imgCenter\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a class=\"objectNew\"><img title=\"Kochi Muziris Biennale\" src=\"http://dc-cdn.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/b220a8437ac2733aafa411e7d352a2782bad0462-tc-img-preview.jpg\" alt=\"Kochi Muziris Biennale\" /></a>&ldquo;When I began the process, I came up with the sort of curatorial pace that came from my own practice as an artist. But, soon I realised that it could be limited. Hence, I started looking outside. I began communicating with people who are not within the expectation of a Biennale space. This led me to look at various art practices within the contemporary art world,&rdquo; Sudarshan continues. He is planning to bring those conversations to the Biennale and hopes that would continue even after that. At such a juncture, the first question popping out would be how they would include those practices which are not seen as a part of the biennale world. &ldquo;That was the very first question we had to face. Of course, there is difficulty in including them. In fact, it was a challenge,&rdquo; says Sudarshan.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a class=\"objectNew\"><img title=\"Kochi Muziris Biennale\" src=\"http://dc-cdn.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/66be00a912cae47f2bea0aff408712351bcee8b8-tc-img-preview.jpg\" alt=\"Kochi Muziris Biennale\" /></a><span class=\"embcaption\">Kochi Muziris Biennale</span>&ldquo;I see Biennale as a whole world. A lot of artists who could not be in the Biennale will be in the programming. Either they would be talking about their practice or having a conversation with others on their style of work. For instance, we have one event where three or four eminent dancers are coming together for a discussion. It is like generating a conversation. We are in the process of calling them and finalising things. So, I cannot divulge more details,&rdquo; he explains.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The second edition of the Biennale was titled &lsquo;Whorled Explorations&rsquo;. The latest edition has taken &lsquo;Forming in the pupil of an eye&rsquo; as its title. Sudarshan explains, &ldquo;It is drawn from the basic idea that when a sage opens his eyes, he assimilates the multiplicity of the world in that moment. It is a confluence of what he sees inside and outside. The concept can also be generic, like an individual looking at the biennale through his eyes.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finding artists has not been a Herculean task. &ldquo;Riyas Komu and Bose Krishnamachari were always there to help me,&rdquo; says Shetty, who had a great time in Kerala, especially in Kochi. He loves Kerala &mdash; its history, long literary tradition and of course, cinema. Shetty has taken cues from the previous editions to zero in on things.&nbsp; He has not deviated from the Biennale&rsquo;s mission statement that describes the venture as people&rsquo;s Biennale. He wishes the 2016 Biennale would get more footfalls. And, he hopes the third edition would bring people closer to art than before.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/painting1475990544165.jpeg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baab806a12cf7ee39133b8","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"looking beyond painting, sculpture"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/books-and-art/300916/looking-beyond-painting-sculpture.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T05:22:31.671Z","udate":"2016-10-09T05:22:31.671Z","expirydate":"2016-12-31T05:21:49.252Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-05T05:21:45.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9d417f2efff597a396a03","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out4865.mp3","tagsForSearch":"looking beyond painting, sculpture","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

For Aishwarya R. Dhanush, dancing is her first passion. &ldquo;We plan something in life. But we end up doing something else.

Dance is pure and divine and it is a beautiful experience,&rdquo; she asserts.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She has been preparing for the day since three to four weeks. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really nostalgic to be back here.

And this year, we are celebrating its 25th anniversary. That&rsquo;s why we decided to have a special dance performance. Our theme will be Ekam meaning &lsquo;The Supreme Oneness&rsquo;. This concept was propounded and established by Adi Sankara. Different batches of students in different age groups will present six items in praise of each of the Gods. Almost 60 students are taking part in the dance programme.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The teacher is more than happy to have Rajinikanth&rsquo;s eldest dancing at the event. &ldquo;She is one of my dear students. Though she has not been dancing much, she would always keep in touch with me. When she came to know that we are doing a special event, she was very happy to participate with our students. Whenever she got time, she practised with other students from the academy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On a concluding note, Aishwarya, who was recently appointed as India&rsquo;s goodwill ambassador for the UN Women organisation, also talks about what&rsquo;s happening next, film-wise &mdash; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve completed shooting a documentary about the stuntmen of Tamil cinema.

While the actual Debipaksha begins only the next day, for the common Bengali it&rsquo;s the narration of this tale from Hindu mythology, beginning with blowing of the conch at daybreak, that marks the commencement of the 10-day celebrations.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aired by All Indian Radio for the first time, Mahishasurmardini features a narrator and a battery of well-known singers. The rich narration and Chandipaath by Birendra Krishna Bhadra in his booming and magical voice has made him irreplaceable even after eight decades. The All India Radio made a few attempts for a remake of the composition, but failed to get a favourable response each time. Even &lsquo;Mahanayak&rsquo; Uttam Kumar, the all-time favourite Bengali actor, was said to be no match, with the audience rejecting the 1976 remake bid featuring him as the narrator.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bhadra has been synonymous with&nbsp;Mahalaya. He, listeners will agree, lives the lyrics, injecting real emotions into the mythological tale. The narrative reaches a crescendo when Bhadra describes the demon&rsquo;s dominance, with the despair over the hopelessness evident in his voice that cracks as he chants on, and if you listen carefully, you can hear his sobs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The music was composed by the legendary Pankaj Mullick, while the singers giving Bhadra company were all top performers of the time.&nbsp;Scripted by Bani Kumar, the composition had Dwijen Mukhopadhyay, Pratima Banerjee, Shyamal Mitra, Sandhya Mukhopadhyay, Manabendra Mukhopadhyay, Arati Mukhopadhya, Supriti Ghosh, Bimal Bhushan, Utpala Sen, Tarun Banerjee, Krishna Dasgupta, Sumitra Sen, Ashima Bhattacharya, Shipra Bose and Pankaj Mallik himself lending their melodious voices. While it used to be a live performance initially, the AIR started playing the recorded version much later. Prasar Bharati CEO Jawhar Sircar recently wrote in a Bengali daily that the version broadcast at present was created in 1966.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ahead of the live performance, old-timers say, Pankaj Mullick used to ensure all the artistes rehearse together for one full month without break. Mullick was so strict that he reportedly kept his favourite Hemanta Mukhopadhyay (Hemant Kumar) out of it because the busy singer could not give time for the rehearsals. The discipline shows in the work that has successfully remained a chartbuster for decades.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The timeless composition has endured all kinds of influence on music in Bengal, with people continuing to play the tracks on Mahalaya year after year with similar enthusiasm. It is as integral to the Bengali psyche as the Durga Puja itself. So much so, that despite so many options available to play it any time, they get up before dawn each year to listen to the masterpiece.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For those who can&rsquo;t tune in to radio, the recording is available on YouTube. There is even an app called Mahalaya for Android and iOS users. The recordings are also available in audio CDs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Set to similar orchestration, a Hindi version is broadcast at the same time for a pan-Indian audience.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/music14752190957491475990683156.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baaa06250c0156ce7311e9","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"mahishasurmardini, an 85-yr-old musical composition that still rules hearts"},{"text":"mahishasurmardini"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://indianexpress.com/article/trending/mahishasurmardini-an-84-yr-old-musical-composition-that-still-rules-hearts/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T05:24:50.451Z","udate":"2016-10-09T05:24:50.451Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T05:24:50.451Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T05:24:44.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9d4a2b38e1d5d6a0c3a3e","tagsForSearch":"mahishasurmardini, an 85-yr-old musical composition that still rules hearts,mahishasurmardini","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

The poise and serenity of the lotus flower can be seen in her paintings which were recently exhibited in the solo show, &ldquo;Unsullied&rdquo; at Alliance Francaise. &ldquo;I am deeply attracted to the quality of a lotus. Just like we see it from the perspective of life, this is how one should live &mdash; unperturbed, unaffected yet making the best use of one&rsquo;s latent inborn talent,&rdquo; asserts the artist. For Jhunjhunwala, nature has always been a muse. This is evident from the landscapes of Banaras and Rajasthan she did for her earlier exhibitions.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The artist using different forms like charcoal, watercolour, acrylic, gold foil and rice paper has perfected the art of fusion of colours and use of different hues.

The dancers are generally trained in music where they can sing and dance. Here recorded music and narrations supported the dancers. In keeping with the format, the vibrant signature tune from an orchestra of dholaki, harmonium and clarinet ushers in the dancers, who are clad in glowing orange traditional Odissi costumes. On entering from two sides of the stage, dancers cross each other as the play begins with the narration. The Sutradhar seeks apology for any inadvertent mistakes, pays obeisance to Lord Jagannath and narrates the story.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Anusuya, the princess by irony of fate, is married to Bishnudas, cursed to a leper by his faithful wife Radha whom he had turned out. Radha became a high-class courtesan Lakhyahira whom Bishnudas and Anusuya meet by chance after years. Seeing the uncontrollable lust of Bishnudas for Lakhyahira, who demands thousand diamonds per night, the duty-bound and devoted Anusuya decides to sacrifice a night with the local king for thousand diamonds in order to offer the courtesan to fulfil her husband&rsquo;s desire. Knowing the truth, the King gets transformed and addresses Anusuya as Mother and offers her the amount.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the play unfolds, Lakhyahira is also able to transform Bishnudas who after a series of events is subsequently cured by the intervention of Lord Vishnu. The dramaturgy highlights few social issues and sets the nobility, sacrifice, purity and devotion of the two women as an example and sends a strong social message in the concluding line (Diyantu milani &ndash;sukhijaney Anusuyar tyagera kahini).</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">An example of choreographic delight and skill of animated beauty by the sensitive, excellently trained and thoroughly rehearsed dancers, the production boasts of matter, style and classical richness of Odissi. Instrumental and vocal music used in appropriate places intensifies the dramatic effect and pronounced textual and musical character.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">There were no props or character costumes and every dancer played multiple roles. Hasta Mudras as Sarpashira was presented as the snake around Lord Shiva. Preetisha Mohapatra entering with quick kneeled-down movements and flapping hands made an amazing Garuda (also the King) with Ritu Sengupta as Lord Vishnu. Rajashri Praharaj&rsquo;s excellent dancing and heart-wrenching abhinaya with a stoic charm of emotions as Anusuya, Aishwarya Singh Dev&rsquo;s stately presence as impactful haughty courtesan with flashes of inner sentiments offered dramatic effects as did Sanjay Behera as leper, the demanding husband Bishnudas and Shiva in the temple. Sipra Swain, Ritu Sengupta, Riyanka Chakravarty and Pragyaparamita Das gave commendable support.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ratikant Mohapatra has dignified &ldquo;Tyaaga&rdquo; with his special choreographic virtuosity to communicate the dance-drama with the specific expressions of the Odia Geetinatya, highly wrought in the classical Odissi dance vocabulary. The steps with superficial variations and additions of the Geetinatya mannerisms like the typical walk with long strides, striking one foot forward, raising of the hand with the &ldquo;Mushti&rdquo; (closed fists) and swings of the lower torso and Dongaria folk elements form the basis of all character dances in the play. With his passion for intellectual as well as geometric order the juxtaposition of walking and dancing brought into confrontation two different styles of performance.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The montage had an original score. The music by Lakshmikant Palit had sprightly rhythms and melodic charm that added detail and density to the aesthetics of the play and so did the light design by Jaidev Das and Debiprasad Misra.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Noted playback singers like Ira Mohanty (Anusuya), Tapu Misra (Lakhyahira) Lakshmikant Palit (King) and renowned vocalists Rupak Parida (father of Anusuya) and Bandish Palit (Bishnudas) added to the distinction of the production.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/odisi14752269864001475991088050.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf66aebfe246bd8ebdfe5","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/dramatising-odissi/article9163786.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T05:31:35.518Z","udate":"2016-10-09T05:31:35.518Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T05:31:35.518Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T05:31:29.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9d637f2efff597a396a48","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out7375.mp3"}

Given our fast-paced lives, we totally understand this, but exercise and fitness are a lot about attitude. You can include a little bit of action in your daily routine without allotting too much time to it, so it becomes manageable. Here are a few tricks that can help you sneak in exercise into your busy schedule, and move one step closer to a fit and fabulous life.<br /><br /><strong>Move more</strong><br />Whatever your daily routine may be, make sure you move around. Even if it&rsquo;s not continuous movement, your body will stay active and so will your metabolism. Take the stairs!<br /><br /><strong>Choose to walk</strong><br />Park your car away from your office so that you can squeeze in a little legwork.<br /><br /><strong>Jog in place</strong><br />Another great way to trick yourself into exercising is to jog in place. You can do this at home or in office while you are busy with another task (just make sure no one&rsquo;s watching you!)<br /><br /><strong>Lift weights</strong><br />No, we don&rsquo;t mean the huge dumbbells in the gym. Lift weights while you are watching TV or talking on the phone.

{"_id":"57f9dbc8339bda5d329798ea","title":"Exploring Vidyapati’s imagery","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<div class=\"articleLead\">\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Seasoned artistes brought alive verses of the 14th Century poet at the two-day Lalit Arpan festival, writes Ranee Kumar</h2>\n</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was one-of-its-kind fests &mdash; the 15th edition of Lalit Arpan Festival. A rare phenomenon where the Gurus of classical dance genres came together on the same platform and interpreted a theme that was equally sui generis. The two-day presentation was like a tribute to the lesser known 14th Century poet Vidyapati whose verses on Krsna-Radha love reflect the ancient dance heroines (nayikas) who are generally typecast into eight nayikas by the treatise &ldquo;NatyaSastra&rdquo;. Vidyapati&rsquo;s poetic language was essentially the archaic Mythili, hence difficult to comprehend, much less to interpret.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">But seasoned artistes that they are, Shovana Narayan, Bharati Shivaji, Ranjana Gauhar, Madhavi Mudgal, Pratibha Prahalad, Geeta Chandran, Jaya Rama Rao and Vanashri and Manipuri exponents Singhajit Singh and Charu Sija Mathur not only took up this arduous theme and translated it into dance, but were able to educate both the connoisseurs and the uninitiated making it an edutainment. The romantic verses of Vidyapati, like Jayadeva (Gita Govindam) move from physical yearning to spiritual satiation (masculine and feminine energies inherent in nature), the crux of Vaishnav bhakti philosophy of the times.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the concert, Shovana, dons the Vasakasajja, a heroine who conscious of her youthful body craving for union with her beloved Krsna decks herself with love intoxicating fragrances and beauty ingredients.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shovana says, &ldquo;Vidyapati was not the first to write on nayikas. It was Bhanudat who first wrote about the eight types of nayikas in pure Sanskrit. But I got this idea of bringing Vidyapati to present day audience with the help of Shalini Rao who was working on the poet. Things fell into place once I contacted my other dancer friends. We decided to delineate each nayika across six dance forms, four each day so that the difficulty of Mythili would be deciphered with clarity.&rdquo; Her tihayees and abhinay together explored Vidyapati&rsquo;s imagery to its full extent.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Madhavi Mudgal and Ranjana Gauhar, both Odissi exponents of calibre, took up the Virahotkantitha and Abisarika respectively. Ranjana&rsquo;s entry with a lighted diya on her palms guarding it from the imaginary wind was breathtaking to say the least. She was the love-smitten nayika who ventured in the dark surreptitiously for a rendezvous with her beloved. Her darting glances, her tip-toed gait, her gestures conveying the cloudy monsoon sky and the moon to cooperate with her brought the abhisarika alive to us. The fragile Madhavi Mudgal&rsquo;s frame fell into place for the Virahotkantitha, a love-obsessed maiden, who is forlorn in the gloomy rain-fed nature in pangs of separation from Krsna who has left the place with a promise to return. &ldquo;I could interpret the nuances of this emotion with ease since I didn&rsquo;t feel it difficult to understand Mythili. That is the reason I took up another piece that complimented the earlier one and I did more of abhinay so that it peters down to the audience who need time for the bhava to sink in, in order to appreciate,&rdquo; says the veteran dancer.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">To Mohiniattam maestro Bharati Shivaji donning the Proshitbhartrika (husband in absentia) seemed a challenge, more so during the poetry and the language, though the bhava (emotion) was intelligible. &ldquo;It was my first experience. It gave a lot of scope to improvise. I added a pan-Indian facet which made Mohiniattam richer. It sublimates from shringara to bhakti. The body and its contours are very crucial to this form as whatever is expressed is reflected through body movements; otherwise it ceases to be Mohiniattam.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Geeta Chandran as the Kalahantarita depicts Radha&rsquo;s reaction to the sight of an exhausted (from love-making) Krsna&rsquo;s but not before she mimes the &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; lord first to &ldquo;Madhura madhu rithu madhukar panti&rdquo; to Bharatanatyam mode. As the irate, pained Radha, Geeta said it all with her eyes and expressive mukhabhinaya while sizing up Krsna. The Swadhinabhartrika (one who held her beloved in subjugation) in the Kuchipudi format by Jayarama Rao and Vanashri went like a duet, while the Khandita nayika (enraged heroine) by Prathibha Prahlad, again in Bharatanatyam and Vipralabdha (duped one) in Manipuri style was depicted by Singhajit Singh and Charu Sija Mathur.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The dramatic element was provided by apsaras in the form of sutradar (narrators Shalini Rao and Shivani Verma), while Dhyanendra Mani Tripathi personifies the poet Vidyapati making for a complete picture. The show conceptualised by Shalini Rao was put together by Shovana Narayan and Jyotsna Suri. India Habitat Centre hosted the show where Shubha Mudgal, Paramjit and Arpita Singh were honoured with Lalit Arpan Samman for 2016.</p>\n<div id=\"articleKeywords\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/imaginery14752271188501475992516206.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf66aebfe246bd8ebdfe5","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"exploring vidyapati’s imagery"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/exploring-vidyapatis-imagery/article9163799.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T05:55:20.564Z","udate":"2016-10-09T05:55:20.564Z","expirydate":"2016-12-31T05:54:47.751Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-04T05:54:42.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9dbc8339bda5d329798ec","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out4463.mp3","tagsForSearch":"exploring vidyapati’s imagery","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

P. K. Doraiswamy explores a few aspects.</h2>\n</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Recently, there was a discussion at the Chennai International Centre on &ldquo;inclusive music,&rdquo; the panel consisting of Gopalkrishna Gandhi and T.M. Krishna. The discussion was quite topical because it was for his efforts at making Carnatic music &lsquo;more inclusive&rsquo; that Krishna is supposed to have received the Magsaysay Award. I am not attempting to summarise the discussion which was too wide-ranging and somewhat difficult to summarise, but I would like to examine some points which came up during the discussion.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Any talk about inclusiveness implies the presence of certain exclusiveness. If so, what does Carnatic music exclude at present? Does exclusiveness refer to the content of the music (musicological and lyrical), its genre, or the structure and policies of the music organisation?</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">If exclusiveness is unjustly discriminatory, it, of course, needs to be straight way condemned and, if possible, eliminated. Classicality implies adhering to certain rules and this automatically involves a certain exclusivity. If exclusiveness is based on essential quality criteria substantive to the character of the activity in question, then it is something not to be diluted if quality and the essential nature of the activity are to be preserved. (The selection of Gandhi and Krishna as panellists automatically excludes others on merit!).</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Exclusiveness essentially means restricting access. So where it is unjustified, the need is to improve the access to the activity without diluting quality-based exclusiveness. Again, access to whom or what? In music, it could be access to certain sections of society, certain genres of music or certain languages or dialects. Let us take them one by one and discuss in the context of Carnatic music.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whom does Carnatic music exclude at present? It is a matter of reality that the Carnatic music scene today is dominated by a certain community. The exclusion of other communities is not total but significant. Whether this is due to socio-cultural factors or a conscious, conspiratorial exclusion of certain sections by the dominant community is difficult to prove one way or the other. If the quality of music is the only criterion being observed fairly and impartially and this results in one community dominating, then the phenomenon is due to socio-cultural factors and not any <em>mala fide</em> on the part of the dominant community.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">One way to set this right is to try and attract children of other communities to Carnatic music by creating easy and widespread access to it and hoping that in due course a sufficient number of them would come to the top. The other way is to follow the reservation model as in government &ndash; a certain number of musicians from other communities are deliberately pushed up into the organising and performing slots along with musicians from the dominant community without being too squeamish about quality. Most will agree that this remedy is worse than the disease.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Are languages other than Telugu and Sanskrit , and other dialects in vogue being largely excluded in Carnatic music? Historically, a lyrical foundation of such high musical quality has been laid by the Trinity in Telugu and Sanskrit that its place would remain unshakeable and irreplaceable whatever other languages are now brought in . Quite a few beautiful Tamil and secular compositions do exist and are in vogue even now but they can only supplement and not supplant those of the Trinity. What about dialects being used to compose Carnatic music? While they can, in theory, be included to compose, most will agree that it is unlikely to enhance the beauty of the compositions. (I wonder how many will think that a composition in Madras <em>bashai</em> will truly enhance the aesthetics of Carnatic music). Even in communities where folk songs are being sung in local dialects, they are enjoyed more because of the meaning of the song than because of the beauty of the lyric.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Is inclusiveness as, or more, important than the quality and character of music? Carnatic music, as a genre, has certain traditional, well-established distinguishing qualities. Should these be changed just to appear to be more inclusive? Should we introduce some elements of folk songs just to make Carnatic music appear more inclusive? Should every genre include some elements of other genres just to make it appear inclusive? Should not the uniqueness of any genre be preserved, or should every genre be a conglomeration of many genres?</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Other genres and dialects can surely be encouraged independently without using Carnatic music as a peg or a platform. It is only when exclusion is unjust and not merit-based that we should talk of inclusiveness.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Krishna mentioned an incident in which a rasika in the audience who was smoking a beedi asked him to sing Khambodi and said that this made his audience more inclusive.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">I do not know whether, if another rasika, sipping whiskey, had asked Krishna to sing Kalyani, Krishna would have considered the audience even more inclusive!</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/inclusivity14752276640721475992634467.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babcefb210157e920b07f9","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"what is inclusivity?"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/a-discussion-on-whether-carnatic-music-is-inclusive/article9162945.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":true,"cdate":"2016-10-09T05:57:19.737Z","udate":"2017-08-17T09:30:35.724Z","expirydate":"2016-12-31T05:56:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-04T05:56:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581c7a751f22cb7941d03d6f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9dc3f5c9c08595eb5622c","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out1002.mp3","tagsForSearch":"what is inclusivity?","updatedBy":"Tags search2","audioImageUrl":"","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null}
{"_id":"57f9dcc6b38e1d5d6a0c3ae0","title":"Call of the Valley","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<div class=\"text-embed\">Pandit Shiv Kumar Sharma tells Manjari Sinha that number of claps should not be the criterion for a successful concert of classical music.</div>\n<div class=\"article-body\">\n<p class=\"body\">In the classical music scenario these days, a nicely packaged recital seems to have become the norm. More often than not, virtuosity sways high but emotions lie low and the grey matter starves for hearty hues in predictable compositions. Artistes like Pandit Shiv Kumar Sharma, in contrast are rare, who prefer soulful sophistication with their supreme control coupled with majestic artistry exploring the unknown. He was in the city recently and agreed for a conversation.</p>\n<p class=\"body\"><strong>Edited excerpts:</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\"><strong>Tell us about the instrument and its journey to the classical status along with you.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\">You may call it destiny. My father Pandit Uma Dutt Sharma, the Raj Pandit of Raja Pratap Singh of Jammu, was a vocalist of Banaras Gharana and the disciple of Bade Ramdas ji. He initiated me into vocal music and tabla from an early age. He was a music supervisor at the All India Radio (AIR), and got transferred to Srinagar for two three years. There he came in contact with great Sufi singers like Mohammed Tibet Baqal, who played this folk instrument called santoor for their Sufiana mausiqi (Sufi music). My father recognised the potentials of classical music in this unknown folk instrument of Kashmir. He did intensive research, developed it and encouraged me to learn and play it to establish it as a classical musical instrument. I call it a destined incident, because it was just by luck or chance, that my father got transferred to Srinagar and got acquainted and deeply involved with this instrument, which was hardly seen by people even in Kashmir by then, not to talk of all over India and abroad.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">In Kashmir, this folk instrument was played with Sufiana mausiqi but the fact of the matter is that this is an ancient instrument that was known as shat tantri veena in olden days. As you all know that in those days all the string instruments were called veena, so the name meant or referred to an instrument with hundred strings. Santoor is played not only in India, but you may find it in different parts of the world with different names.</p>\n<p class=\"body\"><strong>You were already an AIR broadcaster by the age of thirteen, and a good tabla player in demand by then?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\">Yes, but my father had worked hard doing extensive research and developing this instrument for classical music. He dreamt of his son becoming the first musician to play Indian classical music on it. I took it upon myself to fulfil my father&rsquo;s dream. I started a new journey with this instrument committed with full dedication and determination. I still remember my father&rsquo;s friends, the great musicians and Ustads of those times, who advised me in good faith to leave this. They would suggest, &lsquo;You are a hardworking intelligent boy with good training, take up another instrument like sitar or sarod and you will shoot up to the skies of popularity in no time. But I pursued it wholeheartedly and after a few years those very people praised me and said never leave this instrument, you shall reach the top.</p>\n<p class=\"body\"><strong>When did you give your first public performance?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\">It was in Swami Haridas Sangeet Sammelan, Mumbai in 1955. Soon after I was invited to perform at the All India Music Conference, Kolkata in 1956 and started performing all over the country. Pandit Ravi Shankar took me along for the Festival of India in 1968, and I gave solo concerts in forty cities in the U.S. and Canada. From then on, people started recognising this instrument across the globe.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">My first solo album was released in 1960. In 1976 came the concept album \"Call of the Valley\", where I teamed up with Pandit Hari Prasad Chaurasia (flute) and Pandit Brij Bhushan Kabra (guitar) that broke all records of popularity. The album turned out to be one of the greatest hits in Indian Classical music and the rest is history.</p>\n<p class=\"body\"><strong>Tell us about the evolution of santoor.</strong></p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\">This was not a cakewalk. I carried out experiments with santoor for many years to make it more suitable for my classical technique. The modified santoor which I play now has got 31 bridges with a total of 91 strings. It has got a range of full three octaves with a chromatic tuning. I also created a technique for smoother gliding between music notes in order to get the quality of human voice and improvised a new technique of playing that could sustain notes and maintain sound continuity.</div>\n<p class=\"body\"><strong>What is your notion about laya or rhythm?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\">It is not necessary that a person who has learnt tabla would have better sense of rhythm or understanding of it. Laya or rhythm is not just mathematics. It also carries emotion or bhava. Think of the thumri \"Piya ke milan ki aas\". (He hums this thumri immortalised by Ustad Abdul Karim Khan and then sings the same line in a faster pace and shows how the whole rasa-bhava is vanished in the faster speed.) Like the musical or tuneful voice, a real feel for laya is also God&rsquo;s gift.</p>\n<p class=\"body\"><strong>You have been performing for more than six decades but you are also a devoted guru, who charges not a single penny for Vidya-Daan. When did you start teaching?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\">I have been teaching for more than forty years now. I never said no to anyone who came to me for learning santoor because I wanted to popularise the instrument. I have taught numerous students and here I want to say that there is no credit of mine. I am just a medium, destined by some divine power, to spread this vidya. My personal experience is that there are four categories of my disciples. First are those who have studied under me and are playing my music. The second categories are not playing my music because they could not understand it. The third type include those who would touch my feet and address me as Guruji. When I ask them I do not remember I have seen or met them earlier. They would acknowledge that they have learnt it by listening to my music and the fourth category is of those who have learnt and play my music but don&rsquo;t confess and say this is my own gharana. I bless them also to do well.</p>\n<p class=\"body\"><strong>How do you feel at this juncture of your life after achieving so much love from your audiences of classical as well as film music?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\">These days I am trying to educate the classical listeners because I realise that it is our responsibility. We should not tamper or dilute our music according to what they want and relish. There are performers who take the claps to be the criterion of a successful concert but I tell my audience not to clap because it disturbs my concentration.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">I have started a new campaign &lsquo;Music Beyond Entertainment&rsquo; both at home and abroad. When I start playing, I tell my audience, forget about Shiv Kumar Sharma or santoor. Just close your eyes and concentrate on sound. When your attention moves astray, try to bring it back to the sound. This is our age old technique of meditation.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">There is a famous and popular music festival in the US called Womad Festival. It was started by famous pop star Peter Gabriel. It is held in a very big park with variety of musical styles offered. Somewhere you would listen to the fusion music going on, at another rock or pop or jazz music is going on.</p>\n</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/call14752284755051475992770301.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babcefb210157e920b07f9","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"call of the valley"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/call-of-the-valley/article9163831.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T05:59:34.634Z","udate":"2016-10-09T05:59:34.634Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T05:59:34.634Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T05:59:31.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9dcc6b38e1d5d6a0c3ae2","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out7745.mp3","tagsForSearch":"call of the valley","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

I can&rsquo;t comment on the scientific impact, but the fumigation drive is working,&rdquo; said Subhash Arya, the Leader of the House in the SDMC.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The SDMC has borne the brunt of the mosquito menace, with 353 of the total 1,692 dengue cases as of September 24 coming from South Delhi &mdash; the highest of the three corporations.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mr. Arya added that while adult mosquitoes are killed through fumigation, the practice can&rsquo;t lead to total eradication of the disease-carrying insects. However, he said the fogging efforts had been intensified.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not all residents are satisfied though.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">B.S. Vohra, the president of the east Delhi RWAs Joint Front, said that while regular fogging is being carried out, the results are short-lived.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;There is respite from mosquitoes for a few hours or a day at most after fogging, but then the mosquitoes are back. In almost every other household there is a patient of chikungunya or dengue,&rdquo; said Mr. Vohra.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Apart from questions about its effectiveness, there are concerns about the environmental and health impact.

Sowmya at Akashvani Sangeet Sammelan.</h2>\n</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The annual Akashvani Sangeet Sammelan, a music festival looked forward to by connoisseurs of music, was held this year at 24 centres, including Delhi, last weekend. At the Capital, like in the past years, two concerts, one in Hindustani style and one in Carnatic style, were featured on the same evening. The concert was organised at the auditorium of Chinmaya Mission.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chennai-based noted vocalist Dr. S. Sowmya was featured in the Carnatic music session, which followed the Hindustani sitar concert of Kolkata&rsquo;s Pandit Kushal Das. Sowmya&rsquo;s concert started past 8.30 p.m. that evening. It is usually the time concerts get over and the artist and her accompanists had to start their concert at that time. One understands the logistics and other difficulties of hosting the festival on two evenings, which would have been ideal at least in metros and some big cities. However, advancing the timing of the festival by at least an hour, further shortening the inaugural session and doing away completely with the announcements in between two songs (which in any case, one gets to hear these while the concerts are subsequently broadcast by All India Radio), one feels, could have set a better tone and mood both for the artistes and the audience. In addition, Sowmya&rsquo;s voice that evening was the not in a fine fettle.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sowmya began her concert with the popular Saveri raga varnam &lsquo;Sarasuda&rsquo; in Adi Tala in two speeds. Being a short concert of about an hour, Sowmya including a varnam in her recital came as a surprise. Sowmya then had to immediately take up a composition for detailed rendition, which was Tyagaraja&rsquo;s &ldquo;Raga ratna&rdquo; in the raga Ritigowla. It was a well rendered composition. Besides, the scholarly touch while she handled the improvisations, namely the raga alapana (though her voice strained while she was traversing at higher notes), niraval of the phrase &ldquo;Bhagavatottamulu kudi pade kirtamulata&rdquo; from the charanam portion of the composition and the kalpanaswaras, were noteworthy.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sowmya&rsquo;s main item in her recital was Shyama Sastri&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ninnu vinaga&rdquo; in the raga Poorvikalyani. While she sang a scintillating alapana of the raga doing adequate justice, the kalpanaswaras were executed in a rather hurried fashion and did not quite get the required justice it should have got. Sowmya concluded her concert with a Tamil song of Subramania Bharati.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Embar S. Kannan on the violin, Neyveli R. Narayanan on the mridangam and Srirangam S. Kannan on the morsing accompanied Sowmya in this concert. While Embar Kannan&rsquo;s sketch of both Ritigowla and Poorvikalyani were delightful, the percussionists&rsquo; tani avartanam in Misra Chappu Tala, though brief, was engaging. On the whole, a concert that did not give a complete and satisfying concert experience.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The concerts recorded in the 24 centres across the country are scheduled to be broadcast by All India Radio, daily from the October 22 till November end. Akashvani should consider broadcasting all these recordings in their FM channels too on all days for a better listening experience.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/sangeet14752286896561475992878345.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf66aebfe246bd8ebdfe5","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"a scholarly touch"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/a-scholarly-touch/article9163834.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T06:01:23.449Z","udate":"2016-10-09T06:01:23.449Z","expirydate":"2016-12-31T06:00:57.508Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-04T06:00:53.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9dd335c9c08595eb5623f","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out3080.mp3","tagsForSearch":"a scholarly touch","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

{"_id":"57f9ddb9339bda5d32979916","title":"Basic interventions that matter","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e2e34a4ac2d218b1a46","content":"<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Recent years have been a watershed in the public health programme in India. We have managed to eradicate diseases such as polio and tetanus, reduced maternal and child mortality rates significantly, halved the prevalence of tuberculosis and malaria and increased the life expectancy for both adults and children. These achievements reflect the unflinching efforts of the Indian government and all stakeholders in the past two decades to ensure health services reach those who need them the most.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As we move towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) &mdash; which were adopted by United Nations member states at the Sustainable Development Summit in September 2015 &mdash; we aim to build on the eight anti-poverty targets that the world committed to achieving by 2015. To align with the new agenda of the SDGs, which puts women and children at its heart, we are moving from a disease control approach to that of strengthening integrated health systems. This will warrant the prioritisation and scaling of critical interventions that will not only be effective but also have a cross-cutting impact across goals and targets.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">One such simple but powerful intervention is breastfeeding. Despite conventional wisdom about the practice and ongoing efforts to increase the number of institutional deliveries in the presence of skilled personnel, the uptake of optimal breastfeeding practices continues to be low in India, with only 44.9 per cent of newborns initiated within an hour of their birth, and only 64.5 per cent breastfed exclusively for the first six months of life. Breast milk provides vital nutrients to the infant, which is essential for its protection. Around 20 per cent newborn deaths and 13 per cent under-five deaths can be prevented by optimal breastfeeding practices.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Transformative plans</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Over and above the schemes that already promote maternal and child health, the Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare has allotted due focus and dedicated support such as the launch of the National Breastfeeding Promotion Programme &mdash; MAA (Mothers&rsquo; Absolute Affection) last month. Based on recommendations from the World Health Organization and UNICEF, this programme will lay emphasis on the early initiation of breastfeeding (in the first hour of life), exclusive breastfeeding of the infant for the first six months (without supplementation by other solids or liquids including water), followed by continued breastfeeding from 6-24 months along with complementary feeding (introducing age appropriate semi-solid foods and liquids), in urban and rural districts alike.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The MAA programme will train nurses, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) to provide relevant information and counselling support to mothers through last-mile platforms such as Village Health and Nutrition Days (VHNDs). This will ensure that adequate awareness on the benefits of breastfeeding is shared with citizens, especially mothers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Helping mothers</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another recent potentially transformative achievement has been the Maternity Benefit Act (Amendment) Bill (2016) which was passed by the Rajya Sabha recently. The Bill aims to raise maternity leave for women from 12 to 26 weeks in all establishments, including the private sector. It also provides 12 weeks leave for commissioning and adopting mothers and makes it mandatory for establishments with 50 workers and above to provide cr&egrave;che facilities.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">This extends a ubiquitous coverage for all working mothers increasing the scope for child care including breastfeeding. In the long term, this one measure could lead to lakhs more babies not only surviving but also getting a healthy start to life.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just as we were able to raise awareness about the value of vaccines, eradicate polio, and drastically reduce mortality rates across the demographic, we will need to intensively disseminate the benefits of breastfeeding through media campaigns with popular figures, using appropriate information and communication technologies tools, adopting real-time monitoring, and collaborating with all departments concerned to ensure we see the maximum impact.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Breastfeeding is a low-cost, high-impact, community-level intervention that has the potential to protect children when they are most vulnerable and further improve key public health indicators.A renewed focus on the cross-cutting intervention of breastfeeding brings us another loop closer to tightening the comprehensive approach to ensuring good health for all.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is with this conviction that we call upon everyone working towards a healthy India to further accelerate our current momentum by promoting this simple yet effective intervention both at the level of individual and society. It is these small steps that will count towards the big wins we&rsquo;re aiming for. Let us do our BASICS right &mdash; The impact will be far-reaching.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">C.K.

{"_id":"57f9e0e75c9c08595eb562ad","title":"Stories on a frame","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Four years ago, a custom-made Shanghai Tang gown got a lot of attention. Inspired by Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai&rsquo;s painting, The Great Wave, its intricate embroidery featured a silver-grey fitted bodice made up of lines of sequins that ended in a wave and a blue-and-silver skirt that seemed to be embellished with a scatter of sequins, but which were actually embroidered rosettes. What was most interesting was that the work, which took over 600 man-hours to complete, was done by a team of embroiderers led by Kiran AN (50), Sangeetha Saravanan (44), and Yogambika Manoj (33), the brains and &lsquo;brawn&rsquo; behind Thamarai, the Chennai-based house of embroidery that is encouraging and sustaining the intricate art of hand embroidery. Since then, the trio have attracted the interest of some big names, including leather goods brand Hidesign and designers like Vivek Karunakaran and Anamika Khanna. An iconic European house of fashion and a famous shoe designer from the continent are also on their high-profile client list.<br />Today, the six-year-old company with a turnover of `2 crores a year, is expanding, entrenching their reputation in home d&eacute;cor&mdash;they are currently working on a range of customised cushion covers for Harrods&mdash;attracting upcoming designers in Europe and the Middle East, and growing their base by opening a second embroidery unit in Thiruvallur earlier this month. Curious to know more, I navigate a maze of labyrinthine streets in Guindy, where their airy unit takes up an entire first floor, well lit by tube lights and sunlight pouring in through large French windows. When I walk in, I&rsquo;m struck by a sense of calm and coordination&mdash;men dressed in white are bent over fabrics stretched on wooden frames, Kiran is discussing patterns with one of the drawing artists, while Manoj and Saravanan have their heads together brainstorming an upcoming project (wall art for a home in Anna Nagar, where they are experimenting with mixed media). But the quiet is soon broken, with laughs and reminiscences, as the three founding partners take me through their journey.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>First break</strong><br />Turns out, the trio met while working at Jean Fran&ccedil;ois Lesage&rsquo;s Vastrakala, the city-based export house that boasts clients like Christian Louboutin, Lanvin and even European royalty. The heir to France&rsquo;s illustrious House of Lesage (which was taken over by Chanel in 2012), had hired Kiran first, nearly 25 years ago. &ldquo;He loved my earrings, which I&rsquo;d made out of rudrakshas and wooden beads,&rdquo; laughs the 50-year-old, who had completed her class 12 and was debating about further education in England, when a friend told her about the embroiderer. &ldquo;There was no formal interview. I guess he sensed my love for design and that got me the job.&rdquo; Saravanan, who was into hotel management, joined next. &ldquo;A friend of mine worked with Lesage. She was quitting and asked if I would be interested. I didn&rsquo;t know anything about it, but I love dressing up and colours, and I loved the job,&rdquo; she says, telling me the Frenchman picked them based on their personalities.<br />Later, they interviewed and hired Manoj, who had just graduated in fashion designing from Bishop Appasamy College of Arts in Coimbatore. &ldquo;We were all in production and it was a really good learning experience,&rdquo; Manoj says, adding, &ldquo;Lesage trusted us and gave us free rein. The art of embroidery is so diversified, and this helped us learn so many things. We also had the privilege of leafing through his father&rsquo;s archives and creating from it.&rdquo; While work-wise it was all &ldquo;stunningly beautiful&rdquo;, as the years passed, the pressure that went with the job soon began to overtake the pleasure, and Kiran admits she was not happy with the balance. She began thinking about starting something, and one day, in 2010, it just clicked. &ldquo;Yoga walked over to my desk and said &lsquo;maybe we should just start&rsquo; and I said &lsquo;let&rsquo;s do it&rsquo;. I even had the name ready, Thamarai,&rdquo; she shares, adding that Lesage is still a close friend. In fact, he sends clients their way even today, which no doubt continues to cement their reputation in the international market.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Branching out</strong><br />As they put it, all three &ldquo;come in different sizes, ages, languages (Kiran is Tamil, while Saravanan is a Malayali and Manoj, a Telugu), and interests&rdquo;. This means three different perspectives at work that usually meld well&mdash;something that people they&rsquo;ve collaborated with, agree to. &ldquo;They have the advantage of being like-minded people who can take decisions and interact with clients depending on their strengths. There is a nice division of labour, too, which helps them function smoothly without anything coming to a halt,&rdquo; says Vivek Karunakaran, who has teamed up with the entrepreneurs several times, for couture and art installations.<br />Meanwhile, at the unit, I find that something work-related has caught their attention, so I wander among the embroiderers who are working in silence. While one is bent over intricate gold work on a panel that will soon form a collection of kaftans by Moroccan designer, Houda Berrada, another is hard at work at threadwork and cutwork on leather, which will be crafted into clutches. A third painstakingly sews beads on ornately-embroidered motifs in gold, silver and blue&mdash;that combine European and Indian sensibilities&mdash;which I&rsquo;m told is for a French designer. I remark on the unhurried rhythm, and Saravanan smiles that it isn&rsquo;t always so. &ldquo;There are days when the materials come in from Morocco or Russia (where they work with a designer named Alina German) in the morning and have to be returned by evening flight. There have even been times when we have run around looking for people travelling out!&rdquo; The men, most of whom hail from Thiruvallur, specialise in aari, but are equally adept at beading, moulding (3D embroidery), cutwork, appliqu&eacute;, and more. After all, embroidery is a language that &lsquo;each state and country speaks with different designs, but the same alphabets&rsquo;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The road ahead</strong><br />Kiran who handles design and quality, travels often, especially to Paris, because &ldquo;we have to be familiar with what is there so we can produce the same quality here&rdquo;. Even her holidays have become a means to feed her creativity. &ldquo;Last month I went to the UK and, in London, I visited the Tate Modern and the V&amp;A. Wherever I go, I make it a point to see art exhibitions, historical monuments and the like, and absorb as much as possible because anything can spur you to think in terms of design,&rdquo; she says. This passion led them to open their Thiruvallur unit, where they employ 35 embroiderers, 15 of whom are women. &ldquo;Most people there are third or fourth generation embroiderers, but hardly any are passionate about taking the craft forward. They don&rsquo;t want to initiate their children into it either, as they feel it won&rsquo;t give them a good living. We want to uplift them; we talk to them about the value of their craft, and offer them fair wages and job security,&rdquo; she shares. They also keep morale high by sharing photos of the finished products. &ldquo;It gives them joy to see their embroidery being worn by stunning celebrities (singer Beyonc&eacute; was spotted in a pair of jeans from Preciously Paris that bore Thamarai embroidery). They get inspired.&rdquo;<br />Till now, much of their work have come to them thanks to word of mouth. But now, Thamarai is getting aggressive. The partners have set aside a budget for marketing and expanding to new markets. Moving forward, they also want to experiment more, possibly even launch a line of finished products. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d tested the market a year ago, with a line of fashion accessories under the name Audrey, which included jewellery and bags. But with the kind of detailing we do and the quality we maintain, the end product becomes expensive. So we are trying to work the kinks out,&rdquo; says Kiran, adding that they are also planning to participate in an upcoming art exhibition in London, as &lsquo;embroidery as art&rsquo; is a trend that is picking up.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Talk of the town</strong><br />The trio pick their favourite projects</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Design Hotel: &ldquo;For the boutique hotel at Phoenix MarketCity, Chennai, we did three lobbies. In one, we used digital printouts of Bharatnatyam mudras, on which we embroidered just the bangles using real kemp stones and gold soft wire. Another lobby had dancing feet, where we embroidered the anklets using real bells,&rdquo; shares Kiran, adding, &ldquo;The final one is contemporary, inspired by American abstract-expressionist artist, Barnett Newman, where we painted a huge blue canvas with two vertical stripes, and on it, embroidered ghungroos.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hamsa: &ldquo;We teamed up with Vivek Karunakaran for this. We did a nine-metre wall panel for a Chennai restaurant, where we represented the mythical bird flying through the five elements of nature, using different mediums&mdash;from hand painting, printing, highlighting and embroidery,&rdquo; says Manoj. &ldquo;It took us one-and-a-half years to execute, and we used a lot of textures (with appliqu&eacute; and fabrics) and at least 10-15 embroidery techniques, including zari, load stitch with moulding, katcha tanka (long and short stitch) and chain stitch, along with crystal and bead work.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Miot Hospital: &ldquo;Chairperson Mallika Mohandas wanted a seven-metre wall panel at the hospital. We studied the space, the lighting and the colours, and after she gave us a tour of her private garden there&mdash;where she pointed out her favourite flower combinations&mdash;we designed a &lsquo;Tree of Life&rsquo;. It took over 1,400 hours of embroidery, but it looks magnificent on the wall,&rdquo; states Saravanan.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>By Surya Praphulla Kumar</strong></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/stories14752343846281475993825124.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baab05ecbc9256e95c174b","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"stories on a frame"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://indulge.newindianexpress.com/stories-on-a-frame/section/60119","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T06:17:11.951Z","udate":"2016-10-09T06:17:11.951Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T06:17:11.951Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T06:17:07.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9e0e75c9c08595eb562af","tagsForSearch":"stories on a frame","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

But it wasn&rsquo;t until the 1970s that the term &ldquo;French manicure&rdquo; was born. Of course, the white tip is the most well-known and a well-worn nail design when it comes to French manicures. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that that&rsquo;s the only way to wear it. There are countless options to place a twist on the classic.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Paint a slightly wobbly horizontal line across the top. This look keeps the clean and stylish feel of the classic French manicure, but the unusual line at the tip gives it a needed breath of artistry.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Get creative and colourful, and add a line of silver, black or turquoise along the tip. In fact, the colour should be as unexpected as possible. Go for a faded ombre or a more abstract divide made with Mylar or other embellishments for a futuristic look. Or, reverse the entire look and use a coloured base. While we love a good nude polish, sometimes Fall calls out for more fun shades.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Stay with white tips if you find it more attractive but add a thin line of silver or gold glitter where the tip ends to give your nails a subtle yet sophisticated look.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/manicure1475993957807.jpeg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baab806a12cf7ee39133b8","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"manicure"},{"text":"french manicure"},{"text":"natural nails"},{"text":"tips"},{"text":"lemon juice"},{"text":"vinegar"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/fashion-and-beauty/021016/new-edge-manicure.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T06:19:25.336Z","udate":"2016-10-10T05:09:14.312Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-10T05:09:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9e16db547d25d4f55bfda","id":"57f9e16db547d25d4f55bfd8","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out8580.mp3","tagsForSearch":"manicure,french manicure,natural nails,tips,lemon juice,vinegar","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

The compelling way in which John brings life onto the canvas through his intriguing figures is sheer class.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In his latest series of works exhibited at the Mahua Gallery, John has exhibited works, which have been in the making for six years. He has dedicated these works to two saints, both of whom have been widely followed across the globe for their simplicity and preachings &ndash; Sant Kabir and Francis of Assisi.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This long-drawn project compelled John into searching and understanding the interconnectedness of everything that is, not something in abstraction but with direct engagement. This effort began with contemplating and experimenting in soil regeneration and engaging with issues affecting the community in which CF John lives and works. This experiment is powerfully present in the series. CF John&rsquo;s work is a visual story book with meanings and emotions in every single frame.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The artist is instinctive as well as conscious in his multi-disciplinary collaboration, one which includes other artists, earth and water, flora and animals, people with their agricultural practices, daily habits, stories and myths, natural materials, as well as persons and problems he comes across in his social work.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like in the organic world, he relies on everyone contributing to the common whole in a somewhat unpredictable, open-ended manner which now functions both in the form of independent acts and in response to the attendance of the other participants and to the place.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">John&rsquo;s patience, calm and warm gestures towards all living beings are clearly visible in his work. His many-directional involvement has been evident to his art audience, whereas he always emphasises his imperative &mdash; the simultaneous, mutually impacting role of aesthetics, agriculture and social activism.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Having actually had very few solo exhibitions, since the late 1980s, he has organised several interactive events and workshops with installations and site-specific work&nbsp; where references to the presence of nature and people living in its proximity remain vital.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The artist&rsquo;s Kerala childhood recollections of farming processes and movements among the underprivileged fed into his long association with Visthar in Bengaluru, where villagers&rsquo; knowledge and intuition about soil, water and plants was always respected and applied on its campus, where the campus itself became a participant.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Every moment, form and happening demand real physical resolve. And I understand it is in the core of these things that we can find what we seek&nbsp; the &lsquo;song line&rsquo; that connects the immediate with everything before and after,&rdquo; says John.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The exhibition is a collection of some intense work which the artist has been doing for several years. It is an ode to his dedication and narrative prowess. He has captured the emotional journey of women and the way he has picturised their attire, emotions, it resembles a motion picture.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>The showing is on at Mahua Art Gallery till October 12.</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>&mdash; The writer is an art curator and art expert.</strong></em></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/faith14752997134261475994063532.jpeg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baab806a12cf7ee39133b8","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"faith shines on canvas"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/books-and-art/011016/faith-shines-on-canvas.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T06:21:08.868Z","udate":"2016-10-09T06:21:08.868Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T06:21:08.868Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T06:21:04.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9e1d45c9c08595eb562d0","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out8839.mp3","tagsForSearch":"faith shines on canvas","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

With over a dozen French songs on human emotions and relationships, the concert was a medley of moods. The trio of Nyna Vales &ndash; Yann Savel (guitarist, lyricist and composer), Nathalie Carudel (lead voice and backing vocals) and Guillaume Ozanne (drums and backing vocals) -- charmed the audience with their perfectly concocted music.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As Nathalie sang out stanzas, Subhalakshmi filled in the interlude with &lsquo;gamakkams&rsquo; and gracefully picked up the guitar notes by Yann in her violin. With Guillaume renting the drums in the background, the concert presented an unusual yet pleasant music experience. &ldquo;This is not fusion music,&rdquo; clarifies Nathalie, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more like a dialogue between the two different genres of music and we are trying to arrive at something that&rsquo;s more interesting as an end result. We practised for 12 to 13 hours a day for nearly six months to finally make this concert a reality.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">This was the first performance in Madurai. Nyna Vales had visited Chennai last year as guests at the Global Isai Festival. &ldquo;We happened to meet Carnatic musicians and listen to the classical concerts and fell in love with their music. That&rsquo;s when, it struck us that some experiment can be done taking in both French and Indian music,&rdquo; says Yann. &ldquo;We conceptualised the concert after observing the Indian arts. It&rsquo;s a confluence of two aesthetics and since Pop music allows a lot of improvisation we really enjoyed working on it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akkarai Subhalaskhmi who stayed with Nyna Vales at Nantes in the Pays de la Loire region of France last May took five days to get a hold of the idea. &ldquo;It involves a lot of on-the-spot improvisations, as I have to think of corresponding ragas that would choose each of the songs. I don&rsquo;t sing a lyrical song in the concert but add a Carnatic touch to the French songs by doing just the Raga-alapana and Swara passages. I find the whole project challenging yet gratifying at the same time.&rdquo;</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Instruments like the Sarod, Sitar and Ghatam are unknown to French music and the sounds they emit are really amazing,&rdquo; says Guillaume. &ldquo;I feel happy and proud to be part of this concert. I find the Carnatic music to be soothing and emotion driven.&rdquo;</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nathalie has been working on bringing back the singing tradition of France since the past two decades. &ldquo;France is known for the tradition of singing meaningful lyrical songs. Poems and stories were told through music. However, over the years, the lyrics lost importance and the tune was concentrated upon. I and Yann are trying to go back to the tradition and revive the idea of meaningful songs while still keeping the melody intact.&rdquo; Nyna Vales has also come up with a CD titled &lsquo;Les Rencontres Indiennes&rsquo; (Indian Encounters), comprising a collection of French songs with Carnatic instrumental and devotional songs as interludes. It is sung by a group of music students in Chennai and integrated with French pop in the CD called &lsquo;Rencontres Indiennes&rsquo; (Indian encounters).</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The concert is a project supported by Alliance Francaise &ndash; Madras in a bid to promote French language and culture. &ldquo;Started in 1953, the Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise of Madras is an international movement to the service of promoting French language and culture as well as an intercultural dialogue. The concert is part of our exercise,&rdquo; says Pierre-Emmanuel Jacob, Direcor of Alliance Francaise of Madras. &ldquo;After this, Nyna Vales will be performing in Chennai, Delhi, Chandigarh and Goa.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;The objective of holding the concert is to motivate the French learners in Madurai region and to create awareness among the public about French language and culture. Moreover, this is also an interesting program for music lovers,&rdquo; says Milton Powers, Professor and Head, Alliance Francaise of Madras &ndash; Madurai Chapter, The American College, Madurai.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/pop14753026333591475994145546.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf66aebfe246bd8ebdfe5","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"when pop went the raga"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/events/french-band-nyna-vales-performs-in-madurai/article9168515.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T06:22:29.878Z","udate":"2016-10-09T06:22:29.878Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T06:22:29.878Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-04T06:22:06.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9e225b547d25d4f55c003","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out3381.mp3","tagsForSearch":"when pop went the raga","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Rajarajeswari, author and playwright of the drama. &ldquo;The protagonist has lost her past and her desperate search on the social networking sites puts her in touch with many false leads. Many people recognise her, but what one says is different from the other. It is then that she comes across Navin who identifies himself as her lover. He works in the oil rig. He tells her how his life alternates between the desert and the sea.

While the characters who interact with the protagonist on various social networking sites perform on trampolines, the character &lsquo;troll&rsquo; appears on roller skates. &ldquo;Since the whole action happens on the virtual space we wanted a different kind of movement on the stage. That&rsquo;s when we zeroed in on a trampoline. We use the trampolines at crucial moments in the play.

The same happens here also when Siji is trying hard to find out who she is,&rdquo; says Sudhi.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">There will be a riot of colours on stage, with multimedia projectors and big screens integrated into the design. &ldquo;Technology has been put to maximum use in the work,&rdquo; says Sudhi.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the play goes to more stages, more aspects will be integrated.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;More subjects will be taken up and the artistes will also be experimenting with the props on the stage,&rdquo; Rajarajeswari adds.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Actors in the play are Aswathy Chand as Siji, Sarat Kumar as Navin and Prasoon V.

This journey of his brings in its wake the story of identity, patriarchy and the idea of the balance between God, man and nature.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">On how she hit upon the idea, she reveals that fond of stories about Lord Ganapati, she always wondered as to what happened to the elephant whose head was beheaded. &ldquo;I wondered what that myth would become if I made a story based on that. I discussed this idea with Senh Sapru and together we created the plot and characters while she wrote the dialogues. Like a good myth we touch upon many themes and that is what I think myths were created for.&rdquo; In this one hour solo show in English, Ellias gets to play eight characters including that of Master Tuck, the young boy, Makadi, the spider and Moork, the poacher among others.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;We all know the Ganapati story and I am trying to find out another one which is completely fictional based on what could happen if. It is not to provoke but a natural story of identity and finding who you are? &lsquo;Elephant In The Room&rsquo; explores what makes Ganapati a loveable god. It is my way of finding what make Him so lovable and my tribute to Him,&rdquo; says Ellias.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like her earlier production, <em>Yatagarasu</em>, this show too is been described as something which a family can watch together. Happy about children liking her shows, Ellias, says, &ldquo;While &lsquo;Yatagarasu&rsquo; has stories about what growing up in school means with which children can easily identify with, I was thrilled to see children above eight upwards attending &lsquo;Elephant In The Room&rsquo; and those above 14 thinking about the questions it raises especially about the balance between man and nature. I have been told to take this play to the schools like &lsquo;Yatagarasu&rsquo;.&rdquo; Aware of the fact that the audience for the English performer director is very limited, Ellias feels shows like this will help in increasing her audience by reaching out to children.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Meanwhile the staff, moves in to enquire about starters and beverages. Refusing both, Ellias quickly decides to abide by their recommendation for king prawns in Schezwan sauce with vegetarian fried rice for lunch.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Growing up in Mumbai, Ellias comes from family steeped in creativity. Her mother Bina Sarkar Ellias is the editor, designer and publisher of International Gallerie, a global arts and ideas journal while her father Rafeeq Ellias is a photographer and National Award winning documentary filmmaker. &ldquo;My inclination to performing arts was due to my parents. Both very creative people are natural performers at home when they tell stories and imitate other people. So I have their genetic coding. Also my maternal grandmother, Protima used to love theatre, acted in one Hindi film &lsquo;Savitri&rsquo; directed by Phani Majumdar under the screen name Sucheta.&rdquo; Ellias also praises her school and college for giving her scope and space to follow her passion for acting and music. &ldquo;I participated in numerous plays and also learnt to play flute,&rdquo; says Ellias.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Discussing the role of genetics in shaping her career, Ellias says it also made a great foodie. &ldquo;Since my maternal grandmother hailed from Bengal I enjoy illish mach, poshto, simple dal chawal with fried baigan and rosogulla and with my paternal grandmother being a Katchi Memon I acquired the taste for biryani with keema samosa, raita made of pudina and coriander chutney. My parents too are excellent cooks and trained my brother and me to cook when we were children.&rdquo;</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Veering back to acting, Ellias reveals that naturally inclined towards acting she started doing lead roles in school and college but never thought of it as a career. &ldquo;At that time nobody thought on those lines and much less that I would join the Paris L&rsquo;Ecole Internationale de Theatre Jacques Lecoq.&rdquo; Then how did she join this world renowned training centre for theatre? &ldquo;Like all the starting points of my life have been purely accidental this one was too,&rdquo; she quips.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The piping hot prawns and the rice are served. Taking a bite Ellias nods in approval while continuing her saga in Paris. &ldquo;There they do not teach you how to act and they do not give you a script. The whole course is about understanding the world through its movements and nature and how and where do we share rhythms and energies with everything around us and then use that as a palette. It is a beautiful process, holistic making you appreciate beauty in the world, aesthetics and the invisible dynamics of what moves us as opposed to the idea that I want to move in others.&rdquo; That was not all. It changed her outlook forever. &ldquo;As they take in only 30 students from initial batch of 90, it simply changed my gears making me competitive and giving up the laid back attitude. Besides making me desire and want something, the school instilled in me the fighting spirit not physically, but mentally. I was encouraged to think and articulate my ideas and convince others about it. I still recall my argument with my French classmate on a particular concept. Neither could I not speak fluent French nor could he English. So we had this Canadian classmate who stood in the middle translating from English to French and vice versa.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ellias moves on to a couple of slices of the margherita thin crust pizza which she likes. Paris did not just train Ellias for stage but also gave a new dimension to her cooking skills. Encouraged to cook since childhood, she took to baking on weekends with her brother and neighbourhood friends. &ldquo;I would make cookies, cakes and pies which turned out to be tasty. Since my grandmothers, parents and brother were excellent cooks I never had to cook other things. Missing Indian food in Paris I turned to cooking. I called up my mother and neighbours to learn recipes while surfing the net. Soon I was turning out chholas and poha for the girls in my dormitory.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now over the years having honed her culinary skills, she has mastered the art of making delicious chocolate chip and banana cake, pineapple upside down cake, keema hara masala with pav, Bengali dish poshto, specially the bindi poshto and the Goan fish curry which she learnt from her Pakistani aunt. &ldquo;One dish I used to make well was the beef stew but now I can&rsquo;t as it is banned. So there is one dish gone!&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ellias counts herself very fortunate, when it comes to enjoying an array of Indian cuisines at home. &ldquo;Food from all corners of the country and world make it our dining table. Besides the Bengali and Katchi dishes, as a Mumbaikar, I get to taste the great Maharastrian bhakri and fish curry.&rdquo; Is she not forgetting the city&rsquo;s famous street food? &ldquo;Of course, not as I love the chaat, the bhelpuri and pav bhaji. Similarly I like Delhi&rsquo;s chhole kulcha and Chandni Chowk&rsquo;s moong dal and gajar ka halwa and kachoris.&rdquo; Not missing a chance to jest, she adds, &ldquo;I am avoiding this time round because of the raging viral fever in the city.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">On request, Ellias agrees to have gulab jamun, one of her favourite desserts. &ldquo;Even though when travelling abroad I love to taste the local cuisine in order to connect with people, understand their culture, over a prolonged stay I miss eating rice with simple dal made at home with garlic, jeera, hari mirchi and pudina.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">All set to leave after this wonderful lunch and conversation, Ellias while walking towards the exit tells me that all theatre persons are great food lovers. &ldquo;Both are labours of love, passion and dedication. Food and theatre are sensual. One needs to feel and enjoy an excellent play and delicacy.&rdquo;</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/food14753036684881475994586654.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babcefb210157e920b07f9","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"‘food and theatre are sensual in nature’: yuki ellias"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/food-and-theatre-are-sensual-in-nature-yuki-ellias/article9159138.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T06:29:51.965Z","udate":"2016-10-09T06:29:51.965Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T06:29:51.965Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-03T06:29:25.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9e3dff2efff597a396b90","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out7138.mp3","tagsForSearch":"‘food and theatre are sensual in nature’: yuki ellias","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57f9e43ff6280d58e8c2c316","title":"Rediscovering Hamlet","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<div class=\"articleLead\">\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Prof. K. Madavane&rsquo;s adaptation of William Shakespeare&rsquo;s timeless work in Hindi received a warm response for its ingenious style of presentation, writes Diwan Singh Bajeli</h2>\n</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Prof. K. Madavane has directed about 100 plays in English, Hindi, French and German. His directorial art seen in Delhi marks a departure from traditional approach to the production of a stage play. His innovative style is very much in evidence in his recent works like Karnad&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tughlaq&rdquo; and Moliere&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tartuffe&rdquo; which he did for Shri Ram Centre. The &ldquo;Mahabharat Women&rdquo; stands out, which he did about three decades ago, for its contemporary interpretation and profound message.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Delhi theatre lovers gave warm response to his production of William Shakespeare&rsquo;s Hamlet in Hindi translation by Amrut Rai. It was presented by SRC Repertory at its auditorium recently. Apart from the ingenious style of presentation, the production projects Saif Ansari as Hamlet who makes an impressive endeavour to create a tragic character who struggles to humanise a world which is like a prison, petty and malicious. It is a prison where true love is not possible to bloom. Imparting energy and emotional power to his portrayal, Ansari creates a profoundly humane, intelligent and sensitive Hamlet out of tune with a cruel world, a world &ldquo;disjoined and out of frame&rdquo;. He is torn between two worlds &mdash; illusory and real. When he feigns madness, he lives in illusion and when he sees the body of his dearest Ophelia while her grave is being dug, he confronts the stark and cruel reality. His lamentations and heart-rending repentance come from the bottom of his soul. After the encounter of his father's ghost, asking him to avenge his murder, Hamlet's whole being undergoes transformation. He is sceptical about the story of the ghost. He creates a device to expose his uncle who has become the king and married Hamlet's mother.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hamlet is the longish play which needs several hours to complete the playing time. It is really a challenge to stage this world classic of all-time on the stage in its entirety. Prof. Madavane's production runs for about two hours. Its greatness lies in its universality. Every generation discovers in the play its own contradictions. It is a political play, a family drama, senseless bloodshed to grab state power and ruthless suppression of dissent to retain power. Above all it is the tragedy of a tormented soul who declares &ldquo;what a piece of work is man, how noble in reason..&rdquo; In the words of Shakespearean authority Prof. Jan Kott, &ldquo;Hamlet can be summarised in a number of ways: as a historical chronicle, as a thriller or as a philosophical drama.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Prof. Madavane is a widely read and travelled artist. His dilemma is how to discover contemporary elements in the classic without distorting and vulgarising the original work. He emphasizes on the dialogues, &ldquo;There is something rotten in the kingdom of Denmark&rdquo;, &ldquo;Denmark's a prison&rdquo;, &ldquo;Then is the world one&rdquo;, &ldquo;A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst&rdquo;. These dialogues are the inner chord that reflects contemporary anxiety and sensitivity. The first step to make his production reflect contemporary sensibility is the use of costumes. He has totally discarded the idea of designing period costumes. Hamlet is in jeans and jacket. Then using lighting effects, upstage an ambience is created in which state spies and secret agents move about surreptitiously in the dark of the night. It creates a kind of suffocating political culture of a fascist state where life has become horrible. Prof. Madavane&rsquo;s experimental approach in terms of design has its own challenges.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He has removed wings with a view to enact play on a bare stage with a vast vista. But the uses of six wooden boxes with a height of six feet placed vertically occupy much empty space. One block is placed horizontally to be used as throne for the royalty. These blocks are used as exit and entry points and as object to hide spies. The main problem with these blocks is that with every scene they are propelled by the performers to change their space. In this process they have to come out of their characters. The flow of action is also interrupted. If considered essential the number of these blocks should be reduced. If the director intends to use these blocks as a metaphor for prison walls, these should not have been frequently shifted from one space to another.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another novelty of the production is the use of light design. There are no fade outs and there is no interval. Blue lights near the wings remain on throughout the show.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is no attempt to dazzle the audience to create magic. In fact, the play demands a variety of lighting effects to create &ldquo;mood&rdquo; to capture violence, brutality and tormented inner world of the characters and multiple shades of psychological complexity of Hamlet who feigns madness.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Initially, the production tends to be tedious with little life. After half an hour it slowly gets momentum. Some of the scenes like the one where Ophelia&rsquo;s body lies on the ground to be placed in the grave is witnessed by main dramatis personae is powerfully enacted. Similarly, the scene where drama-within-the drama is staged by artists before the king and queen to enact the treacherous murder of the father of Hamlet to expose the villain is noteworthy. It is presented in a stylized manner which has the gripping power of a ballet. The scene is choreographed by Anjana Rajan with intricacy and lyrical rhythm. The climactic scene deserves special mention for its tragic depth and captivating power. In the sword fight scene Hamlet is no more obsessed with, &ldquo;To be or not to be&rdquo;, he fights like a seasoned brave fighter adept in warfare. He inflicts mortal wound on his adversary &mdash; Laertes. There are bodies of Hamlet, Laertes, Claudius and Hamlet's mother. Horatio, Hamlet's loyal friend lives to tell the story of Hamlet to &ldquo;this harsh world&rdquo;.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Prof. Madavane has worked hard with his cast, which has little experience in working Shakespeare's plays, to make their performances creditable. However, the Hindi accent of the most of the performers is not up to the mark. Saksham Shukla as Polonious, indulges in spying his children and on Hamlet and his conversation with his mother, is killed by Hamlet when he is hiding to listen to what is being talked about by the son and mother. Kunwar Himanshu Tyagi as the son of Polonius and brother of Ophelia and Smita Singh Parihar as Ophelia, who commits suicide after her lover Hamlet refuses to respond to her love, bring their characters to life. (Smita Singh Parihar would have made her Ophelia more convincing if she had imparted tenderness and poetic intensity to her character). Ashutosh Kumar Keshav as King Claudius stands exposed towards the end and gets an ignominious death. Sugandha Shrivastava as Queen Gertrude and mother of Hamlet is endowed with an impressive stage presence.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/hamlet14753039770001475994682045.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babcefb210157e920b07f9","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"rediscovering hamlet"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/rediscovering-hamlet/article9163843.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T06:31:27.225Z","udate":"2016-10-09T06:31:27.225Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T06:31:27.225Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-03T06:31:17.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9e43ff6280d58e8c2c318","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out2227.mp3","tagsForSearch":"rediscovering hamlet","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

They were last revised by the Indian Epilepsy Society in 2008.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr G.T. Subhas, consultant neurologist, PMSSY Super Specialty Hospital said, &ldquo;It is a continuous process as classifications are changing and with the advancement in treatment methods and diagnosis for epilepsy, the need for updating the guidelines becomes important. With the advent of new drugs, treatment has improved, but it also carries the risk of side effects. Hence, there is a need to have guidelines in place to recommend what drugs to administer at what stage.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At present, there are over 30 drugs to treat epilepsy patients. If the new guidelines are approved by the State government, there would be a clear classification on what drugs could be prescribed at what age.

{"_id":"57f9e4c0b547d25d4f55c037","title":"Sense of a Beginning","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Inside Khirkee Extension in Delhi, narrow mud paths are barely lit. The street is filled with people, sitting on either side, watching the theatre of every day unfold. In a tiny hole-in-the-wall electrical store, Swati Janu runs a temporary &ldquo;phone recharge shop&rdquo;. &ldquo;Isme video gana dal do,&rdquo; says Hasim, handing over his phone. A contract labourer from Bihar, he is among the many who have contributed to Janu&rsquo;s media library. This past month, she has been exchanging songs and videos of Hindi and Bhojpuri cinema, sometimes Congolese and Afghani, for free, with residents of the area as a barter for what they have on their memory cards. Her work is a part of the month-long Khoj Studios&rsquo; residency programme.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A crowd slowly piles up on the street, as Janu begins video projections, laying Caribbean &ldquo;chutney music&rdquo; thick on the wall as a Bhojpuri song plays out for an audience, which includes people from Bihar, Nigeria, and Iran. &ldquo;As an architect, I&rsquo;m curious about unorganised settlements and informal exchanges. Memory takes on a digital form, through photos and videos,&rdquo; says Janu. This &ldquo;cultural mash-up&rdquo; is what she presents at &ldquo;Coriolis Effect: Migration and Memory&rdquo;. The group show is a culmination of the art residency at Khoj, where Andrew Ananda Voogel, Chibuike Uzoma, Joao Orecchia, Liza Grobler, Malini Kochupillai, Mahesh Shantaram and Janu are showcasing their work, primarily centered around Khirkee Extension, which sees multitudes of migrants every month.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Neighbourhoods make photographer-urban researcher Kochupillai curious as well. She presents a newspaper (in English and Hindi), called Khirkee Voice or Khirkee Awaaz. The 12-page tabloid has stories of a Khirkee tailor who dreams of going back to South Africa, hidden stories of an African kitchen, even a snippet on dragonflies crossing the seas from south India to Africa. As one who has lived in the area and documented the African community for over four years, she says, &ldquo;For me, public spaces are everything. It&rsquo;s the living room of a city. My work subverts the notions one associates with Africans. For instance, one often reads of Nigerian criminals, not of artists. We need such spaces for dialogue.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With Grobler, that dialogue can happen within a cocoon of colour. Her floor-to-ceiling installation, made from wiry, green, woolly pipe cleaners, is pretty much like a weaver bird&rsquo;s nest. &ldquo;I am concerned about how ideas meet. Those small exchanges we have with each other, and how that shifts our thinking. From the outside, the experience of the installation is very different, but once you step into it, it shifts everything. With every new experience, your memory changes,&rdquo; says Capetown-based Grobler.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Coriolis Effect or the deflection force in nature appears in an abstract form in each art work, says curator Sitara Chowfla. &ldquo;Khoj&rsquo;s neighbourhood of Khirkee Village is a dense urban-village environment that is home to immigrants from India and across the global South. We have seen increased friction, particularly during and after the raids in the area by political leaders. There were tensions; there were also islands of acceptance. We would find beauty salons and food outlets that were by Africans. We&rsquo;ve been contemplating the theme of migration; we became more aware of the rich history between Africa and India. We wanted to enquire into what happens to memory, your identity, when you lose your place of belonging?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nigerian artist Uzoma places himself on the streets of Old Delhi, to understand and, maybe, accept where he is. Photographs that show him as a tourist also mark his absence in the frame. &ldquo;To me, migration is about memory. And memory is very fragile.

He shared the story of a Northeast lady, who would pass by a shop every evening, from where she bought stuff. She had grown to know the family, until, one day, when she returned home at night, the son assaulted her. The story inspired his work He Was Decent until it Got Dark. His text-on-textile project at has words from newspaper headlines, or phrases he&rsquo;s seen on trucks.

While one image captures a slice of life in Palestine&rsquo;s Gaza Strip, the other expresses the fantasy of escape. The two images will be a part of a festival, titled Gaza51, which aims to sensitise Indian audiences to what it means to be young and living in a relentless conflict.

The festival rose out of Hyderabad-based drama therapist Mahnoor Yar Khan&rsquo;s many visits to Gaza in the past 20 years. Gaza51 will exhibit works by people between 14 and 25 years that show their responses to the 51-day attack and present aggressions.

A recent survey of more than 18,000 people from 134 countries found that 68 per cent of people feel they don&rsquo;t get enough rest.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While previous studies have analysed the negative health effects of not getting enough sleep, less is known about the broader impact of not getting enough rest. In order to start a dialogue about the importance of rest and relaxation, and encourage more substantial research on the subject, researchers at the UK&rsquo;s Durham University launched an online poll they called the Rest Test.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The poll asked participants about their resting habits, how much time they were able to spend resting on average, and what activities they perceived as most restful. It also asked participants to report on their sense of well-being. The researchers reported their results on the BBC Radio 4 programme The Anatomy of Rest and say they will publish a full analysis next year. Researchers not only found that more than two-thirds of respondents felt they didn&rsquo;t spend enough time resting, but that 32 per cent believed they needed more rest than the average person. A mere 10 per cent, meanwhile, claimed they needed less rest than the average person. Participants who felt they needed more rest were also more likely to have lower well-being scores, while those who either claimed to need less rest, or were able to spend more time resting, reported higher well-being. Some of the most restful activities, according to participants, were reading, being in a natural environment, and being on their own. &ldquo;These results show just how crucial it is to our well-being to ensure people do have time to rest,&rdquo; says Radio 4 presenter Claudia Hammond. &ldquo;We can begin to try to work out what the optimum amount of rest might be and how we should go about resting.&rdquo;</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/resting1475994943898.jpeg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baab806a12cf7ee39133b8","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"survey"},{"text":"relaxation"},{"text":"sleep"},{"text":"health"},{"text":"rest uk’s durham university ×"},{"text":"rest"},{"text":"uk’s durham university"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/health-and-wellbeing/031016/are-you-resting-enough.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T06:35:52.012Z","udate":"2016-10-10T05:09:14.312Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-10T05:09:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9e548f807295d859fe84c","id":"57f9e548f807295d859fe84a","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out5094.mp3","tagsForSearch":"survey,relaxation,sleep,health,rest uk’s durham university ×,rest,uk’s durham university","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

In a synagogue, lit only by candlelight, he could hear people mourning.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When he enquired, he realised they were Jews, lamenting the destruction of their first and second temples in Jerusalem. He assumed it had happened in the recent past. But when he learnt it was nearly 2,000 years ago, Bonaparte remarked: &ldquo;A people who mourn their temple for thousands of years, will also live to see it rebuilt.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As Rabbi Abraham Cooper, Associate Dean, Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC), Los Angeles, narrates the story of Bonaparte, he also affirms what the exhibition &ldquo;People, Book, Land: The 3,500 Year Relationship of the Jewish People with the Holy Land&rdquo; presents. At IGNCA&rsquo;s Twin Art Gallery, Delhi, the show, organised by SWC and UNESCO, traces the journey of the Jewish people through their history, values and love for their homeland. Robert Wistrich, anti-Semitism scholar, who authored the 25 panels on display, has highlighted the cultural exchanges that were prominent in Jewish history in the Middle East, from Biblical times to present day.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">SWC, a global human rights organisation that confronts anti-Semitism in the urban world, chose to premiere this exhibition in Delhi, after its debut in the UNESCO headquarters in Paris in 2014, and its run in New York. &ldquo;Our concern is not politics. You will not see weapons or maps or tanks in this exhibition, it&rsquo;s about values. I believe this show is our best defence against stereotypes,&rdquo; says Rabbi Cooper, declared by Newsweek as one of the most influential rabbis in the US. Author Simon Sebag Montefiore of Jerusalem: The Biography (2011) says, &ldquo;The story of Jerusalem is the story of the world&rdquo;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are introduced to Abraham in the exhibition panel &ldquo;Children of Abraham&rdquo;. The shared ancestor of Jews, Christians and Muslims, he is seen as the progenitor of the Jewish people through Issac, and of the Arab nation, through his elder son Ishamel. We also meet King David, a great military leader, and a poet (author of the Psalms), and his son King Solomon. An 18th century painting of The Judgement of Solomon &mdash; the familiar story of two women claiming a child as their own &mdash; is on display.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While King Nebuchadnezzar II exiled Jews and destroyed Solomon&rsquo;s temple, King Herod, though a tyrant, rebuilt the temple. To him, an entire panel is dedicated, which tells of his building projects. Then came the Arab conquest, the Crusaders and the Muslims, the Mamluks and the Ottomans. Jerusalem is a central motif in every aspect of Jewish lives. It&rsquo;s evident in the panel &ldquo;If I forget thee O Jerusalem&rdquo;, which, besides being a verse from the Psalms, is often recited at weddings before the breaking of the glass, in memory of the destruction of the temple, and the hope of returning from exile.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By 1845, there were barely 12,000 Jews in Israel, ridden by disease and poverty. Philanthropists Anglo-Jewish Moses Montefiore and French Edmond de Rothschild, his brother-in-law, would buy land, start banks and encourage people to take up agriculture. Rabbi Cooper recounts how Montefiore asked people to look beyond their suffering, and work for living to sustain themselves. The European diaspora slowly began returning to their land. This &ldquo;ascent&rdquo; produced three future Israeli prime ministers (David Ben-Gurion, Moshe Sharett and Levi Eshkol) and presidents (Hzhak Ben-Zvi and Zaman Shazar). By 1948, Israel won independence from the British.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Amid all this, the holocaust unfolded. While six million Jews were either shot, gassed or murdered, few international voices spoke up. This led the Jews to believe only &ldquo;national sovereignty, an army and a political centre in the land would help them defend their existence.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From these shadows, would grow a &ldquo;People of Hope&rdquo;, who today stand with the world in relief projects, combining humanism with technology.<br />&ldquo;We know that economies go up and down, and geo-political systems change, but the affinity between India and Israel, of shared values, curiosity and soft power, will help us work together,&rdquo; says Rabbi Cooper.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The exhibition is at Twin Art Gallery, IGNCA till October 9</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\">&nbsp;</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/UNESCO14753162910861475994969559.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baaa06250c0156ce7311e9","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"land of remembrance"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/art-and-culture/land-of-remembrance-unesco-delhi-exhibition-3053358/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T06:36:14.619Z","udate":"2016-10-09T06:36:14.619Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T06:36:14.619Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-03T06:36:00.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9e55ef6280d58e8c2c339","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out4450.mp3","tagsForSearch":"land of remembrance","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Acute diarrhoea, ecoli bacteria, amoebiasis, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis E and leptospira are some of such common water-borne illnesses.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is a worldwide fact that during monsoons and after heavy flooding, Hepatitis E, caused due to contamination of food and water, is commonly reported. Dr K.Shivaraju, senior physician head of the department for general medicine at Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences, explains, &ldquo;Hepatitis E or jaundice damages the liver and shows very high enzymes in the blood. In such cases, the immunity of a patient determines the severity of the disease. If the immunity is low, it can severely damage the liver and become life-threatening. But if the immunity is strong, it can have a mild effect on the patient.&rdquo; A liver function test and serological tests are done to identify the disease.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The other common infections are respiratory infections and parasite infections such as amoebiasis and worm infections, caused by eating contaminated, stale and unhygienic food.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Receding flood waters also offer breeding ground for mosquitoes which transmit insect-borne infections through bites and cause diseases like malaria, dengue and chikungunya.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr Ravi Kiran Barigala, infectious disease consultant at Apollo Hospitals, says, &ldquo;Most of these infections are minor and get cured by itself. But if there is continuous vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, abdominal pain, joint pain or jaundice, they need to consult a qualified physician. Drinking lots of fluids such as coconut water or ORS solution helps to maintain hydration levels. The medication should not be discontinued midway, which is a common practice. Also antibiotics should not be taken without the advice of physician.&rdquo;</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If vomiting and diarrhoea continue for more than four days despite medication, it is time to get hospitalised and seek secondary treatment.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Common mosquito-borne infections:</strong><br />1. Scrub typhus &mdash; Transmitted by insect bite; it causes fever, Eschar and multiple systems in the body<br />2. Dengue &mdash; A viral fever affecting platelets and liver function; can be life-threatening<br />3. Malaria &mdash; caused by anopheles mosquito. It causes fever, jaundice and multi-organ failure in severe cases<br />4. Long-term illness is unusual but people with low immunity are susceptible to viral fever and chikungunya, which affects the brain and require aggressive treatment. Some cases are fatal.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Preventive steps</strong><br />1. Avoid water stagnation and eating food prepared in unhygienic conditions<br />2.

Darius ruled over approximately 50 million people, i.e, at least 44 percent of the world population. The land across the Indus, or parts of &lsquo;India&rsquo;, is supposed to have been part of his territory ruled by his satraps. But this claim has been contested by Indian scholars. What is, however, undeniable is that trade and culture united the two civilisations .</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An interesting exhibition, Qand-e-Farsi wa Tutiyan-e-Hind (Of Persian Candy and Indian Parrots), with aesthetically curated panels, shows that books, and knowledge, were steady items of exchange between both. These books were not some nondescript titles but the big books of India &ndash; the Panchantantra, Ramayana and the Mahabharata &ndash; that inspired works of literature everywhere.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Panchatantra was one of the major inspirations behind Rudyard Kipling&rsquo;s Jungle Book,&rdquo; says well-known Urdu aficionado Kamna Prasad, who has curated the exhibition.

Tamilarasan, a four-year-old boy at Chinna Edayathur, Thirukulakundram, is terrified at the sight of the Anganwadi centre there &mdash; not because of having to study, but because his teacher-cum-help demands that he fetch the groceries, clean the centre and much more. To add to his trauma, he claimed that the food given there was stale. His mother, a casual labourer working under the MGNREGA scheme, had to quit working to take care of him.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Child rights activists opine that if the Anganwadi centres in the country had functioned effectively, malnutrition levels among children would have reduced to a significant level. A Unicef report, titled &lsquo;Committing to child survival: A promise renewed&rsquo;, said that &ldquo;in the year 2011, around 1.7 million children across the country did not live to witness their fifth birthday due to acute malnutrition.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though initiatives by the Health Department, Integrated Child Development Services Scheme (ICDS), and various organisations have helped bring down the burden of malnutrition, the problem continues to persist in both rural and urban Tamil Nadu.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;The state health department has been working with ICDS on various programmes to bring down the burden. Most of the responsibilities being carried out are joint responsibilities. The issues of health, nutrition and sanitation are interrelated,&rdquo; said Director, Department of Public Health, Dr K. Kulandaisamy.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;With the help of ICDS workers, we have been conducting an &lsquo;Immunisation programme&rsquo; to check vaccine-preventable diseases, like diphtheria, whooping cough, polio, measles and tuberculosis. In addition to that, we administer Vitamin A to the children, once in every six months. This is done to prevent Vitamin A deficiencies,&rdquo; he said adding that two millilitres of Vitamin A is administered to children above six months, up to five years of age.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The state health department also carries out an anaemia control programme, wherein syrup and tablets are administered to the children for 100 days.<br />&ldquo;We also give the children de-worming medicines twice a year,&rdquo; added the director of the department.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">About 770 mobile medical teams have been set up exclusively for schools and ICDS centres across the state, so as to check the health status of the children there. The aspect of nutritional education is also being looked into.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Despite all these initiatives being taken up, malnutrition among children continues to exist due to various factors, including infections, genetic problems during birth, multiple pregnancies, and the like,&rdquo; said paediatrician Dr. Lekshmy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />The health department gives iron tablets and de-worming medicines to pregnant women along with nutritional advice. &ldquo;Gross malnutrition in the state has disappeared and the impact of the efforts of the initiatives can be seen through the fact that children today are taller than their parents and grandparents,&rdquo; stated Dr. Kulandaisamy. &ldquo;We get help from various organisations like World Vision of India, Children&rsquo;s development groups and Unicef,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, a reality check at the ICDS centres shows how food is often insufficient for the children as the workers swindle the groceries. &ldquo;From fetching the firewood for cooking to cleaning the rooms, kids are made to carry out arduous tasks. Swindling of the groceries by the workers is highly observed,&rdquo; added Advocate of High Court, N. Lalitha</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Most workers are unaware of the concept of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Nutrition&rsquo;. How then can they take up the task of providing nutritious food?

As for the Bengaluru edition, they would like to focus more on the historical narratives and local stories.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;We want the artists to talk about their experiences and stories from their city, which is why we have included the most number of artists from Bengaluru.&rdquo; Out of the fifteen artists taking part in the festival, eight of them are from the city.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">MG Road, Cubbon Park and Majestic will see the larger art projects which will be open to all, while there will be numerous smaller installations, temporary pieces popping up throughout the city. &ldquo;We have tied up with the BMRC to work on the metro stations and the central part of Bengaluru and more than anything else, this is about exploring context driven artwork,&rdquo; Akshat explains.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Founded in 2014, the organization has organized four street art festivals so far, 3 in Delhi and one in Mumbai and one is never similar to the other, says Akshat. &ldquo;We do the same festival in different formats so that it&rsquo;s new every time.

Or better yet, how about taking a stroll around the city and treating your senses to an invigorating plethora of street art?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kick-starting this month, lovers of art have enough and more reason to be upbeat with the St+Art India Festival or the Street Art Festival. With Bengaluru fast gaining a reputation of being a mecca for arts and culture, it comes as no surprise to witness the first edition of the festival looking right at us this month &mdash; from the first week of October to November 2 in and around Majestic, MG Road, Cubbon Park, Mantri Mall, Church Street and Indiranagar.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While the public arts extravaganza has rustled up a storm across the country, we highlight a volley of Bengaluru-based artistes about what they&rsquo;ve pinned their hopes on...</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shilo Shiv Suleman, a Bengaluru-based visual artiste, who&rsquo;s works are a focus on the intersection of magical realism, art for social change and technology, explains, &ldquo;This festival marks my second innings with the&nbsp; St+art India Foundation. I previously had my murals exhibited&nbsp; at Lodhi Colony, in New Delhi.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">For me, it was always about conveying messages that&nbsp; engage with gender issues and art for social change in India. I&rsquo;ve always believed this city to be a space for art of all kinds. But it&rsquo;s indeed a breakthrough from the ubiquitous exhibits, so I am indeed looking forward to making this city my canvas.&rdquo;</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unfazed by how it will pan out, the artist from namma ooru, who previously founded the Fearless Collective, an art initiative for social change tells us, &ldquo;For an artist, it&rsquo;s about spreading a meaningful message. I hope onlookers get what I&rsquo;m trying to convey through the canvas.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With 14 artistes from across the country who will be a part of the festival, what&rsquo;s interesting is that this platform will unleash unbridled thoughts and emotions. Speaking of the same, Ullas Hydoor, a city-based architect who moonlights as a street cum mural artiste, opines, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always created art that is highly reflective of the prevailing socio-cultural conflicts we widely see around us. Through my street art and graffiti, I want to narrate thought-provoking tales of the ever-changing times.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Enthusing how he sees the idea as an opportunity to pay tribute to the city. &ldquo;To me, in addition to this being a leeway to express my emotions, I also see this project as a tribute to the city. My works will entail my daily observations from over the past 11 years, of the little things that make Bengaluru a home away from home. To me, this is freedom in its truest form. And yes, I&rsquo;m quite elated as I believe this city&rsquo;s people are open to giving art a chance,&rdquo; says Ullas. &nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pegged as a first of a kind podium for anyone with an eye for art to join in, the idea brings seasoned as well as aspiring artistes under one roof. Echoing his views on similar lines, Siddartha Karaval, a city-based seasoned artist, who&rsquo;s previously been a part of notable festivals such as the India Art Fair 2013 and Kochi-Muziris Biennale 2012, tells us, &ldquo;Though I wouldn&rsquo;t want to disclose much about what I&rsquo;ll be doing, all I can say is that the idea is to build a connect. And I choose to do it by centering it around happiness, a universal emotion that we&rsquo;re all in search of.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Clearly, while everyone has caught on the buzz, Akshat Nauryial, content director, St+art India reiterates how the focus is to build a connect in a city where all forms of art see a resurgence, Bengalureans today&nbsp; are already fairly receptive to the idea of public art. Moreover, the people here seem to also be sensitised to local issues and are not afraid to make their voices heard.

{"_id":"57f9e8285c9c08595eb56372","title":"The quintessential vidwan","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Carnatic music vocabulary, we do not seem to have any one word that describes the deeply engaged musician who is also a performer, thinker, linguist, philosopher, educator, scholar and collaborator. But, maybe there is an expression, the one that imposters like yours truly feel we deserve and at times demand: <em>vidwan</em> . If there is a person who embodies that term, it is the wonderful musician R.K. Shriramkumar.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shriramkumar grew up with the best of musical influences, from T. Brinda to D.K. Jayaraman. At home, Carnatic music was the only known mode of celebrating life. His house was the epicentre that attracted the young crop of musicians from the mid to late &rsquo;80s. Inherently, the violinist has the ability to grasp and internalise music with lightning swiftness and to aid this, a photographic memory. This combination has helped him absorb music from many maestros. All that was said, left unsaid, suggested, analysed and deconstructed, has stayed with him. At the same time, this has not been a blind intake of knowledge; he has a most sophisticated sieving system.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">When so much is taken in, the mind needs to decide the following: what is needed, what can be discarded, when, where and how much should be released, and most critically, what are the constants. For Shriramkumar, this process of receiving, retaining and relinquishing is just natural and therefore, what you finally hear is the quintessential Carnatic.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ragas are companions with whom he converses, not opponents that need to be subdued or defeated, allowing them to glide towards us listeners. Every <em>swara</em> and phrase of his offers us a glimpse of music beyond the musical; you are shaken and stirred. He is certainly not the most skilled or technically perfect violinist. But those who are unable to receive him beyond these limited and limiting criteria are the ones losing out on a profound experience.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unfortunately, the Carnatic music world is so obsessed with &lsquo;main artistes&rsquo; that prominent recognition has eluded him. Shriramkumar is known to many as a tunesmith and composer of Pallavi. But he must be celebrated as an outstanding <em>vaggeyakara</em> (poet-composer). He may not have composed hundreds of songs and compositions, but his few outweigh the many that pass off as <em>kirtanas</em> .</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a deep thinker, Shriramkumar does not take anything at face value. He probes, investigates and navigates every thought. He may not immediately accept a contrary view, but with some reflection, will come back and continue the conversation. And at times, he would be honest and courageous enough to tell you that he agrees with your point, yet finds it hard to change the way he is. &ldquo;I am working on it,&rdquo; he would say.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">From the surface, do not think that he is an easy person to convince, far from it! He can be bull-headed and refuse to budge, but the trickster that he is, you will never realise that he had vetoed your thought or castigated you.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He is a linguist who grasps the nuances of languages with ease. He reads and understands all the south Indian languages, is a master of Sanskrit, and dabbles in Marathi, Gujarati, Hindi and a few others. He is constantly exploring linguistics and semantics, and is in wonderment whenever he sees a new meaning, interpretation, sound and history to a word.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Heart of hearts, he is an <em>advaitin</em> , for whom <em>atma vichara</em> is at the heart of living, while being at the same time deeply ritualistic and Brahminical. But his search for the real does not reject or discard its inherent contradictions. There is also the other side to him, the deeply passionate seeker of beauty, love and romance.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">When people see Shriramkumar, there are two opposite imageries that arise in their minds. For some he is the &lsquo;ideal&rsquo;, the perfect Brahmin man: pious, god-fearing, respectful Carnatic musician. Others see him as conservative, archaic, rigid and un-modern. But what these positions reveal are our own beliefs, judgments and complexities. Shriramkumar is neither ideal, nor is he old. He is complex, difficult, challenging, open and flexible, yet rigid and tied down, like anyone of us. It is just that in his case, his overt classicism is a shield that makes it difficult for others as much as it does for himself.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">I know there is so much more depth to what he says than what is heard, and I am disturbed that his thoughts have been straitjacketed within a cultural milieu. And hence, I have constantly pushed him to discard diplomacy, correctness, inhibitions and fear, reveal his own doubts and say it the way he sees it.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shriramkumar has been an integral part of my life for the past 28 years. I am here today because he has been, and still is, with me as a confidant, mentor, discussant and dissenter. There are many who wonder how we could be such close friends.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The answer lies in the question itself. Maybe there is hidden in each something of the other.&nbsp;</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/music14754748024661475995683389.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf66aebfe246bd8ebdfe5","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"the quintessential vidwan"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/the-quintessential-vidwan/article9178168.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment&ref=tpnews","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T06:48:08.843Z","udate":"2016-10-09T06:48:08.843Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T06:48:08.843Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-03T06:47:44.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9e8285c9c08595eb56374","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out2717.mp3","tagsForSearch":"the quintessential vidwan","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Though robotic-assisted thoracic surgery facility is now available at only two centres in the state, it is getting wide acceptance due to its multiple benefits. Experts advocate robotic surgeries as they considerably reduce the post-surgery complications and lessen chances of infection.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Robotic surgery is now increasingly used in several thoracic treatment procedures like removal of lung tumours and thymus gland and pulmonary lobectomy to remove the lobe of the lung containing cancerous cells,\" said Dr K.R.

However, in robotic thoracic surgery, only an 8 mm incision is made which will considerably bring down the chances of infection and other post-surgery complications. In open surgery, the functional disability after the surgery is a major problem for patients, especially manual labourers. The robotic procedure does not affect their ability.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr Shiv K. Nair, senior consultant, department of cardiovascular and thoracic surgery at Rajagiri Hospital, describes it as a revolutionary surgical innovation with a bright future. \"The robotic arms have more flexibility and precision than the human wrist which is why it is better than typical non-invasive laparoscopic surgery,\" he said. \"Though the massive capital investment is the major challenge now, I think the cost of the machine will come down soon as more countries have started manufacturing it,\" he observed.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/thoracic1475995825523.jpeg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baab806a12cf7ee39133b8","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"thoracic surgery"},{"text":"robotic surgeries"},{"text":"dr shiv k. nair"},{"text":"dr k.r. balasubramaniam"},{"text":"robotic arms"},{"text":"rajagiri hospital"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/health-and-wellbeing/031016/thoracic-surgery-goes-robotic-way.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T06:50:34.606Z","udate":"2016-10-10T05:09:14.312Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-10T05:09:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9e8ba339bda5d329799c5","id":"57f9e8ba339bda5d329799c3","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6386.mp3","tagsForSearch":"thoracic surgery,robotic surgeries,dr shiv k. nair,dr k.r. balasubramaniam,robotic arms,rajagiri hospital","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57f9e9b9b38e1d5d6a0c3bf3","title":"Experts trying to figure out if zika is spread by sweat or tears","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e2e34a4ac2d218b1a46","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Washington: </strong>It's been almost four months that the first Zika virus-related death in the continental U.S. occurred, but two aspects of this case continue to puzzle health experts.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First, why did this patient die? It is quite rare for a Zika infection to cause severe illness in adults, much less death. Second, how did another individual, who visited the first while in the hospital, become ill from Zika? This second patient did not do anything that was known at the time to put people at risk for contracting the virus.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Details from the two cases point to an unusually high concentration of virus in the first patient's blood as being responsible for his death. The phenomenon may also explain how the second patient may have contracted the virus by touching the tears or sweat from the primary patient, the first such documented case.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"This rare case is helping us to understand the full spectrum of the disease, and the precautions we may need to take to avoid passing the virus from one person to another in specific situations,\" says corresponding author Sankar Swaminathan.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He collaborated with coauthors Robert Schlaberg and Kimberly Hanson from ARUP Laboratories, and Julia Lewis, D.O. from the University of Utah School of Medicine.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"This type of information could help us improve treatments for Zika as the virus continues to spread across the world and within our country.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From the letter in NEJM, a story unfolds. Last May, patient one, a 73-year-old man, traveled to southwest Mexico, a Zika-infected area. Eight days after returning, he started having abdominal pain and fever, and by the time he was admitted to the University of Utah hospital he also had inflamed, watery eyes, low blood pressure and a rapid heart rate. Despite the medical staff's best efforts to stabilize him, his condition declined rapidly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">During this time, patient two came to visit and reported wiping away Patient 1's tears and helping to reposition him in the hospital bed. It wasn't long before Patient 1 slipped into septic shock, and his kidneys, lungs and other organs started to shut down. He died shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though it's well known that Zika can cause severe brain damage in unborn babies, symptoms are typically mild in adults. Only nine other Zika-related deaths have been reported worldwide, says Swaminathan.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Despite the odds, tests performed after Patient 1's death revealed that he had Zika. Patient 1 was initially identified as being potentially infected with Zika virus during validation of a real time PCR test for Zika virus that is currently under development at ARUP Laboratories, and was subsequently confirmed as positive by both the Utah Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Further investigation using Taxonomer, a tool developed by scientists at University of Utah and ARUP Laboratories, that rapidly analyzes all genetic material from infectious agents in a patient's sample, showed there were no other infections that explained his illness. It also found that the Zika virus that infected the patient was 99.8 percent identical to that carried by a mosquito collected from southwest Mexico, the same region that Patient 1 had visited a few weeks prior.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Seven days after Patient 1's death, Patient 2 was meeting with Swaminathan to talk about what had happened when the doctor noticed that his visitor had red, watery eyes, a common Zika symptom. Tests confirmed his suspicion, but in contrast to Patient 1 this patient only had mild symptoms that resolved within the following week.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like Patient 1's death, Patient 2's diagnosis was unexpected. The species of mosquito that carries Zika had not been found in Utah and Patient 2 had not traveled to a Zika-infected area. A reconstruction of events ruled out other known means of catching the virus.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"This case expands our appreciation for how Zika virus can potentially spread from an infected patient to a non-infected patient without sexual contact or a mosquito vector,\" says Couturier. \"This and any future cases will force the medical community to critically re-evaluate established triage processes for determining which patients receive Zika testing and which do not.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The authors believe that the reason behind the unusual nature of the case lies in yet another anomaly.

{"_id":"57f9ea49f807295d859fe8c2","title":"To stage or not to stage: Theatre censorship in India","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In December 1872, the Calcutta National Theatrical Society staged Nil Darpan, a play written by Dinabandhu Mitra, that exposed the atrocities committed by British indigo planters on Indian farmers. While the play received glowing reviews in most newspapers with nationalistic leanings, it was expectedly criticised by the British press. There was a demand that the play be banned. Other plays followed, criticising and making fun of the white rulers. Finally, in 1876, came the Dramatic Performances Act, putting restrictions on the public performance of plays.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cut to 2016. Nearly seven decades after the country&rsquo;s independence from British rule, actor-director <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/amol-palekar-moves-hc-against-pre-censorship-of-play-scripts/story-fR8XMXRhJl5mKZF4FCyiII.html\" shape=\"rect\">Amol Palekar</a> moved the Mumbai high court in September, challenging rules framed under provisions of the Bombay Police Act, 1951, which make pre-censorship of drama scripts mandatory by the Maharashtra State Performance Scrutiny Board. In his petition, Palekar said the rules framed under the provisions of the Act were arbitrary and violated citizens&rsquo; fundamental right to freedom of expression, guaranteed under the Constitution. However, on September 26, the state government told the Bombay High Court that in March this year, the then commissioner of police had repealed the rule which required prior scrutiny of theatre scripts. Palekar has not replied to HT&rsquo;s email requesting an interview. Repeated calls to advocate Sugandh Deshmukh, who is representing him in court, also went unanswered. But veteran theatre personality Alyque Padamsee who had filed an affidavit in support of Palekar&rsquo;s petition said he is not surprised by the court proceedings. &ldquo;It is the way bureaucracy works,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What the law says</strong></h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Censorship of theatre in Maharashtra dates back to 1948 when a need was felt to have laws to stop the exploitation of women who performed in tamashas. In 1951, the Board for Prior Scrutiny of Tamasha came into being. Later, with a few amendments, it was renamed the Maharashtra Rangbhoomi Parinirikshan Mandal or the Maharashtra State Performance Scrutiny Board.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Theatre groups have to submit two copies of the script to the Board for clearance before it can be staged. &ldquo;The Board acts as a watchdog, because the kind of scripts we get have elements that can upset society. Our job is to avoid that,&rdquo; says Arun Nalavade, chairman, Maharashtra State Performance Scrutiny Board. The cleared script had to then obtain a performance license from the Mumbai Police&rsquo;s license department. This step has been discontinued since March. However, a no-objection certificate from the local police station is still required. If the scriptwriter or director is unhappy with the Board&rsquo;s decision he may request a meeting. If no consensus is reached, he may move court. Court proceedings, however, often take time. And the verdict, even if in favour of the scriptwriter or director, is not always able to do justice. Padamsee gives the example of Partap Sharma&rsquo;s A Touch of Brightness. &ldquo;Years back the play was to be performed abroad as part of a commonwealth arts festival. The Board ruled that it cannot be performed abroad. I was the director of the play. Sharma filed a court case against the Board decision and eventually won the case. But by then the event was over,&rdquo; recalls Padamsee.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_800x600/HT/p2/2016/10/01/Pictures/_7700e842-87e8-11e6-ad59-fe0cd67003de.jpg\" /><strong>Down the years</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In a previous newspaper article, Palekar gives the example of Vijay Tendulkar&rsquo;s play Gidhade or The Vultures. In August 1970, the Board had banned the play claiming that the realistic portrayal of perverted socio-familial complications in the play, was unsuitable for a public performance. After the producer and the director of the play protested against the ban, the play was finally allowed to be staged after a few cuts. But the theatre group, and the audience of course, had the last laugh. The play began with the announcement that &ldquo;in compliance with the objection from the censor board, the red stain on the rear of the sari of a particular female character who leaves the stage with her back to the audience, will henceforth be blue in colour.&rdquo; In 1974, another Vijay Tendulkar play, Sakharam Binder, became the target of the moral police.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;The concept of having a censor board now is absurd because it is a live performance. There is bound to be on-stage improvisations and technically even if one word is changed from the approved script, we are breaking the law. As for the law and order aspect, there is a whole set of other laws to take care of it,&rdquo; says theatre director-producer Sunil Shanbag. In 2009, Shanbag directed Sex, Morality and Censorship, which at its core presented the well-documented history of Sakharam Binder and the discomfort it had caused many. Playwright-director Ramu Ramanthan remembers how his plays Comrade Kumbhakarna (2011) and Cotton 54, Polyester 86 (2006) ran into trouble with the Board because they had named famous politicians. &ldquo;That had to be changed. After that, I had to use allegories to get my point across to the audience without naming people. What is worrying is how the censor board seems to be getting more teeth after Independence,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The concept of censorship, many feel, is especially meaningless today, when the Internet makes every kind of content easily accessible to everyone.</p>\n<section class=\"story_top_news\">\n<div class=\"news_photo\"><img src=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_800x600/HT/p2/2016/09/30/Pictures/_5fa82e2e-86eb-11e6-aa25-6de36c266871.jpg\" /></div>\n<h2>A scene from the play Comrade Kumbhakarna written by Ramu Ramanathan, directed by Mohit Takalkar and produce by NSD repertory school. (S. Thyagarajan (NSD) )</h2>\n</section>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>And elsewhere...</strong></h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And yet, pre-censorship of theatre is not restricted to Maharashtra. Gujarat is another state which has a law for censorship of theatre. &ldquo;We do have a censor board, but the members are all playwrights and theatre actors and directors. The board members are elected by the Gujarat Sangeet Natak Akademi and the state government. But the Board is very liberal. We are even free to stage anti-establishment plays, but we don&rsquo;t name people or parties,&rdquo; says Shailesh Tevani, a dramatist and drama critic in Gujarat.</p>\n<div id=\"div_storyContent\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Outsiders going to Gujarat with their plays though, have a different story to tell &ndash; yes, even if your company is based outside Maharashtra or Gujarat, and you have staged a particular production across the country, you need an approval from the censor boards in these two states to stage the play there. Delhi-based theatre director Sayeed Alam remembers the run-in that he had with the censor board in Gujarat. &ldquo;We had already had already staged a play called Maulana Azad across the country. We wanted to stage it in Gujarat. But the censor board there objected to a line in the play where Maulana Azad says &lsquo;Sardar Patel was perhaps the founder of India&rsquo;s partition&rsquo;. I explained to them that it was not a line written by the scriptwriter, but had been taken from Maulana Azad&rsquo;s book, India Wins Freedom. The censor board wanted us to cut out that line. We didn&rsquo;t agree, so we couldn&rsquo;t stage it. A few years later we did stage the play in Gujarat, but that was at a private show,&rdquo; says Alam.</p>\n<section class=\"story_top_news\">\n<div class=\"news_photo\"><img src=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_800x600/HT/p2/2016/09/30/Pictures/_6e140d52-86eb-11e6-aa25-6de36c266871.jpg\" /></div>\n<h2>A scene from the play Maulana Azad, directed by Sayeed Alam that ran into trouble with the censor board in Gujarat (Photo courtesy: Sayeed Alam)</h2>\n</section>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not that Alam, or other Delhi-based theatre groups enjoy complete liberty in the national capital. In Delhi, any performance needs a license from the Delhi Police&rsquo;s licensing unit, one of the requirements of which is that a &ldquo;brief synopsis about the performance containing details of the artist and contents of the programme&rdquo; be mentioned. Organisers also have to give an undertaking that the show does not have any &ldquo;profanity, impropriety of language, indecency, anything likely to cause riot or excite feelings of sedition or political discontent etc&rdquo;. &ldquo;If the synopsis gives us the feeling that something in the play may lead to a law and order problem, we withhold license and ask the local police station under whose jurisdiction the performance is taking place to investigate. Even after the license has been granted, if we get a complaint or find out that the terms of the undertaking are being violated, we serve the organisers and auditorium owners a show cause notice. Their license may be cancelled too,&rdquo; says a senior cop working in the licencing unit.</p>\n<img src=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_800x600/HT/p2/2016/10/01/Pictures/_659c4830-87f2-11e6-ad59-fe0cd67003de.jpg\" />\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In recent years though, Alam feels, the ease of performing in Delhi has improved. &ldquo;Much of it is because of the Sheila Dikshit government. Earlier, we had to approach at least five-six agencies of the Delhi Police &ndash; traffic, licencing, local police etc before being allowed to perform. Now we can just apply at one place and they get the necessary documents. Even the Aam Admi Party government is supportive to theatre groups,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Anasuya Vaidya of Delhi&rsquo;s Akshara Theatre, who has made a film on theatre censorship, remembers a time when laws were stricter in Delhi and how her parents, Jalbala Vaidya and the late Gopal Sharman, always fought against them. &ldquo;Since we had our own auditorium, it was easier for us to not comply with unfair rules. We never submitted a script or even a synopsis of the play to any authority, nor did we ask any group that was performing at our theatre to do it. There were phone calls and visits by officials, but our shows were never stopped,&rdquo; says Vaidya. In Mumbai though, since the group has to perform at a theatre not owned by them, they do have to send their scripts to the censor board. &ldquo;At one of our plays the Board had said we can&rsquo;t use the word &lsquo;balls&rsquo;. We felt it was an integral part of the script and the humour would be lost if we replace the word. So we just went ahead and performed without any changes. Thankfully no censor police was sent to check whether we had made the changes,&rdquo; says Anasuya, with a laugh.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Read:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-gearing-up-to-clip-censor-board-wings/story-HZWU8GiunBzZPt2ZiQU7qJ.html\" shape=\"rect\">Government gearing up to clip censor board wings</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Apart from the ridiculousness of such censorship, there are also practical pitfalls of censorship. &ldquo;It encourages a parallel economy of agents or touts whom you pay to get the license or censor approval quickly and easily,&rdquo; says Delhi-based theatre director Aamir Raza Husain. &ldquo;Sometimes, if you are in a hurry, these agents will get you approval in a day. One feels then that the Board is not really reading the script. So what is the point then?&rdquo; he questions.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then there is the eternal question of whether cops or a state-appointed or elected committee have the merit to judge what is not right in a script. &ldquo;They say if you do not agree with the decision of the Board, you can move court. Then let whoever has a problem with the play also move court against it. Why this system of pre-censorship,&rdquo; questions Alam.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/censorship-of-plays-ended-in-march-maharashtra-govt-tells-bombay-hc/story-iYXxLJeYLbDgyTUDYj5pWN.html\" shape=\"rect\">Amol Palekar&rsquo;s </a>case at the Mumbai High Court is pending decision. (A bench of Chief Justice Manjula Chellur and Justice MS Sonak felt that after the relevant rule was repealed, nothing was left to hear. However, it posted the petition for further hearing on next Tuesday after the defence counsel sought time to check on the state claim that the law on censorship has been repealed.) Unless the case manages to strike down censorship completely, it would have achieved little apart from fanning the debate on the issue again.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>(With inputs from Anesha George)</strong></p>\n</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/censor14754920635521475996228988.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57bab78473031e7ec856e982","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"to stage or not to stage: theatre censorship in india"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-stage-or-not-to-stage-theatre-censorship-in-india/story-mYugbkUmhqWUU7nc52z43L.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T06:57:13.627Z","udate":"2016-10-09T06:57:13.627Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T06:57:13.627Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T06:57:10.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9ea49f807295d859fe8c4","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out4612.mp3","tagsForSearch":"to stage or not to stage: theatre censorship in india","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

And the organisers this time promise newer elements that will set the stage for a stronger regional art market.

In an interview, Fazzone talks about their plans for the upcoming edition. Excerpts:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What is your assessment of the India Art Fair since its inception in 2008?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The IAF has established itself as the leading art fair in India. It has acted as both a catalyst and an aggregator for the art market in India, bringing galleries, artists and collectors together. The event measures success by the quality and range of work it shows, innovation, strong representation of the South Asian region, sales and the impressive footfall &mdash; which increased from 10,000 during the first edition to over 1,00,000 visitors in 2016.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How will the regional art fairs, of which India is a part of, be different from the brand of Art Basel? And why not&nbsp;</strong><strong>bring Art Basel to India?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Regional art fairs cater to a particular area through their engagement with collectors, galleries, artists and stakeholders, and are a point of reference in that region. The size of a region may vary, from a city to a state, from a country to a whole continent. The IAF, for example, is exceptional for its engagement in South Asia. We shall retain and develop the regional integrity of each fair in the portfolio. It is not intended to make the regional fairs into global fairs like Art Basel.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What new can we expect in the February 2017 edition of IAF?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We will focus on sharing expertise regarding the offered services &mdash; physical and digital. We are currently<br />developing a new digital offer for IAF 2018. As the leading face-to-face platform for art in India, it deserves an<br />integrated digital platform.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What is your impression of the current art market in India?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We have chosen India as the first regional art fair on account of the current growth and momentum of the country&rsquo;s economy, and its growing art market. Many new collectors are entering the market as art becomes a popular and important part of many more people&rsquo;s lives.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">-&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><a id=\"written_by1\" class=\"bulletProj\" style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/author/catherine-rhea-roy/\">Catherine Rhea Roy</a>&nbsp;</span></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/marco-fazzone-75914754966200781475996437066.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baaa06250c0156ce7311e9","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"on the record: art of the matter"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/art-and-culture/marco-fazzone-art-basel-india-fair-iaf-3062037/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T07:00:42.251Z","udate":"2016-10-09T07:00:42.251Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T07:00:42.251Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-03T07:00:19.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9eb1af6280d58e8c2c3be","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out8630.mp3","tagsForSearch":"on the record: art of the matter","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Mumbai-based Pranita Kocharekar was only trying to capture her own struggle, as well as that of her friends, with the fairly common condition when she made the series called &ldquo;Is That You?&rdquo; and posted it on Instagram. With the perfect mix of gentle humour and poignant accuracy, the works quickly went viral, and many people responded to the illustrations with stories about their own struggles.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;The number of responses I got was overwhelming, but I made sure to respond to everyone who wrote to me,&rdquo; she says, adding, &ldquo;My objective was to raise awareness about something that isn&rsquo;t very widely spoken about, and I wanted to do it the right way. I realised I was not alone when I suffered my bouts of anxiety and I wanted to make sure that others who have suffered similarly, also know that they are not alone.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Over the last two years, Kocharekar has become one of the most well-known names in illustration and graphic design areas in India.

Also, the fact is that the work is a little too commercial for my taste, and I genuinely wanted to do work that was not only different, but would actually make a difference,&rdquo; she says.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ever since, Kocharekar has worked on a number of well-received projects &mdash; personal and professional &mdash; freelancing for agencies such as Ogilvy &amp; Mather, Lowe Lintas, FCB Ulka and Grey Worldwide. It&rsquo;s in her personal projects, however, that the artist shows what she means by &ldquo;making a difference&rdquo;.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Besides &ldquo;Is That You?&rdquo;, she has created what she describes as &ldquo;short stories for children&rdquo; on Instagram, where a particular story unfolds over a series of posts in a specified period of time. Each story revolves around an issue that Kocharekar wishes to highlight, such as the importance of judgment-free acceptance, in Ponch the Whale. Her most recent series of illustrations have been on the importance of mindfulness.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3062051\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/10/illustration-759.jpg\" alt=\"Pranita Kocharekar, indian illustrator, illustrator mumbai, Is That You, is that you illustrations, is that you series, relatable illustrations\" width=\"759\" height=\"422\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An early personal project that was particularly successful was Until Next Time (2014), which Kocharekar describes as &ldquo;greeting cards with honest emotions&rdquo;.

But there are some fun ways to keep fit and hulahooping is one of most fun exercises. While it takes some practice to be good hula-hooping, but once you are able to do it you can target a wide range of muscles in your body with the hula hoop. Through hula hooping you can tone and strengthen your arms, legs, buttocks, thighs, abdomen and realign your spine too. You can easily find several simple and fun hula hoop exercises over the internet for your arms, legs, core, abdomen and back. In order to help you realise how you should give hula hooping a try, here are some amazing health benefits of hula hooping exercises.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tones core and abs</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hula hooping makes use of most of your core and abdominal muscles. When your body moves to keep the hula hoop in rotation, it uses most of those muscles providing them an effective workout along with simultaneous stretching and aerobic exercise. If you wish to keep your waist line toned, you should try keeping the hoop in rotation around your waist for 5-7 minutes. You can perform 3 sets of 5 minutes of hooping for best results.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Improves stamina</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While hula hooping seems quite simple and is actually lot of fun, it needs some continuous efforts from the core muscles. People who aren&rsquo;t fit may find it difficult to keep the hoop in rotating for long. But since it feels like more of a fun game than an exercise, people continuously get better at it. With time hula hooping keeps on boosting their stamina and soon people are able to keep the hoop going for much longer.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Enhances concentration</h2>\n<div class=\"_teraMainAdContainer\" data-attr=\"done\">\n<div class=\"_teraAdContainer\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hula hooping requires coordination between various muscles. If you are able to move your muscles at the right time, only then you can keep the hoop going. So hula hooping not only tones up your body but it also helps you boost your concentration levels. You develop improved ability to focus on different muscles at the same time.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Helps with weight loss</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hula hooping can help you lose weight, especially if you have got excess fat around your waist. Hula hooping provides good aerobic movements to your upper body, helping it burn more calories. With 10-15 minutes of hula hooping every day you can expect to lose some weight from around your waist.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Busts stress</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Next time you feel stressed and have got a hula hoop lying around, just go for it. Hopping helps with stress and depression like any other fun sport. If you enjoy hula hooping you will be able to lower the stress levels with only a few minutes of hopping.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/hoop1475996551026.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","publisherSectionName":"onlymyhealth.com","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"fitness"},{"text":"abs"},{"text":"hoop"},{"text":"exercise"},{"text":"stamina"},{"text":"weight loss"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.onlymyhealth.com/fitness-benefits-of-hula-hoop-exercise-1475240343","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T07:02:38.820Z","udate":"2016-10-10T04:43:27.259Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-10T04:43:00.000Z","publiseherSectionId":"57f9ea99339bda5d329799ff","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9eb8e339bda5d32979a18","id":"57f9eb8e339bda5d32979a16","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out4376.mp3","tagsForSearch":"fitness,abs,hoop,exercise,stamina,weight loss","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

By the restless energy with which he threw himself into the many different genres of creation whether it be painting, sculpting, mural art, installations and writing on art, he reminds us of the myth of Sisyphus. At the start of a new day of creation, Arakkal would be ready with a new series and carry it up the mountain. When he reached the summit, his only thought was how to start again.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I think the artist today has to be something of a performer,&rdquo; he confesses, &ldquo;Picasso was a great performer, though he was also the greatest artist of his time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">That was how Arakkal liked to measure himself. Against the greatest artists of his time and those that had come before him. It explains why in many of his works there are references to the works of the greats as he liked to call them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>A thrilling moment</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of his most thrilling moments was when he was awarded the Lorenzo il Magnifico Prize at the Florence International Biennale of Contemporary Art on 6th Dec. 2003.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is how he described it soon afterwards:&ldquo;My work, entitled, &ldquo;War, Guernica Reoccurs&rdquo; was one of the largest canvases in the show and was given a very central place in the display,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but with all those works around I never had any hope of winning the award. There was a dinner concert on the last day. We returned in time for that and just as I was walking into the pavilion, I heard my name being announced as the second prize winner: The Lorenzo il Magnifico silver medal. I could not believe it! In my acceptance speech I said it was an award for my country and that I was elated to win an award in the city of Michaelangelo.&rdquo;</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was a long journey for Arakkal, the rebellious son of a royal family of Kannur in Malabar who fled to Bengaluru working at many menial jobs before he found himself a place at the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). While he was welding pieces of metal together, he was also forging his place as an artist in the heady atmosphere of the city of endless delights that was Bengaluru in its heyday. Even before he had finished his apprenticeship as an artist at the Chitrakala Parishath College at Bengaluru and a stint at Garhi studios, Delhi as a print-maker, Arakkal was holding the first of his many one-man shows, attending every artist camp to which he was invited and making a place for himself in the tumult of the artist&rsquo;s world.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>A soaring imagination</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">His mind and his imagination soared just like the kites in the paintings of the 1980s and 1990s. They float in a riot of coloured panels soldered together by the restless brush marks, or indentations of his palette knife. He often worked in a series. It could be a kite, a crow, a solitary bed, an old man staring out of a window with bars, a chair, orange robed monks, women of Benaras in white, Egyptian symbols, not to mention his &lsquo;quotations&rsquo; from famous works of art. Like the pirates of Malabar he plundered the treasures of the world and made them his.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As his close cousin and confidante A. M. Sikander remarks, &ldquo;Yusuf was a very special artist and a unique human being. He was looking forward to having the Jesus series that he had painted to be exhibited at the Vatican one day. Then again, he would not have wanted to be known as a religious artist, but one for whom the love of humanity was more important.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yusuf, dear friend, you will be missed.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">(Contemporary artist Yusuf Arakkal passed away on October 4, 2016 in Bengaluru.)</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/yusuf14755818209921475996621126.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf66aebfe246bd8ebdfe5","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/yusuf-arakkal-19452016-dialogues-with-immortality/article9184128.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T07:03:45.452Z","udate":"2016-10-09T07:03:45.452Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T07:03:45.452Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-03T07:03:21.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9ebd1f807295d859fe8d9","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out2797.mp3"}

This typically occurs when fluid from inside blood vessels seeps outside the blood vessel into the surrounding tissues, causing swelling. This can happen either because of too much pressure in the blood vessels or not enough proteins in the bloodstream to hold on to the fluid in the plasma (the part of the blood that does not contain any blood cells).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pulmonary edema is the term used when edema happens in the lungs. The immediate area outside of the small blood vessels in the lungs is occupied by very tiny air sacs called the alveoli. This is where oxygen from the air is picked up by the blood passing by, and carbon dioxide in the blood is passed into the alveoli to be exhaled out. Alveoli normally have a thin wall that allows for this air exchange, and fluids are usually kept out of the alveoli unless these walls lose their integrity.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pulmonary edema occurs when the alveoli fill up with excess fluid seeped out of the blood vessels in the lung instead of air. This can cause problems with the exchange of <a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/intestinal_gas_belching_bloating_flatulence/article.htm\" rel=\"dt\">gas</a> (oxygen and carbon dioxide), resulting in breathing difficulty and poor oxygenation of blood. Sometimes, this can be referred to as \"water in the lungs\" when describing the condition to patients.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pulmonary edema can be caused by many different factors. It can be related to <a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/heart_failure/article.htm\" rel=\"dt\">heart failure</a>, called cardiogenic pulmonary edema, or related to other causes, referred to as non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.<span id=\"cntid\">&nbsp;</span></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/featured-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disorder-copd1475996749723.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","publisherSectionName":"medicinenet.com","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"pulmonary edema"},{"text":"lungs"},{"text":"breathing difficulty"},{"text":"gas"},{"text":"heart failure"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.medicinenet.com/pulmonary_edema/article.htm","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T07:05:58.665Z","udate":"2016-10-10T04:43:27.259Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-10T04:43:00.000Z","publiseherSectionId":"57f7998d5c9c08595eb55a03","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9ec56f2efff597a396c65","id":"57f9ec56f2efff597a396c63","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out7005.mp3","tagsForSearch":"pulmonary edema,lungs,breathing difficulty,gas,heart failure","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

They nest in man-made structures such as eaves or walls of buildings and behind electric meters. We all grew up with these gregarious birds, their cheerful cherr&hellip;cherr&hellip;cherr&hellip; punctuating our days, as they thrived on the rubbish that humans generated. But the last few decades have seen a massive decline in their population, as the birds cannot cope with the changing urban architecture, glass walls and steel surfaces, scarce water sources, and disappearing worms and bugs.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sood approached a group of conservationists associated with the Indian Birding Fair. They provided him with a sparrow nest box and feed box, which he fixed on an outside wall. As he saw the birds taking to the boxes eagerly, in the next two years, Sood brought many more boxes. The birds came in dozens, making the boxes their home and breeding. Soon, his garden and slowly the entire neighbourhood had become full of house sparrows.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The nesting box is not new. It&rsquo;s an idea that conservationists have been using for some years now. And it&rsquo;s amazing how just a small wooden box and feeder can encourage a species to start again. The Birding Fair activists have so far supplied about 1,200 sparrow nest boxes in Jaipur. And a recent citizens&rsquo; review found that the drive had helped add a significant 8,000 sparrows to the environment. The boxes allow two sparrows to mate inside undisturbed, and when the eggs are hatched, the parents can go looking for feed while their eggs stay safe from crows and other predators. Similar efforts have been undertaken in other cities as well. The boxes are also good for other birds that nest in holes, like owls, myna and parakeets.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In fact, Rajasthani folk singer Vandana Singh talks of how she installed a bright purple box for sparrows but ended up with a myna instead, for whom she had to enlarge the opening. Now, she plans to get a second box in brown for the sparrows.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The house sparrow figures in the Birds of Conservation Concern Red List. The British Trust for Ornithology is at present running a house sparrow appeal to raise funds to carry out research and monitoring of the species to better understand the pattern of decline.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to noted environmentalist, and the soul behind the Indian Birding Fair programme, Harsh Vardhan, house sparrow numbers have more than halved in the last 25 years across India. As green spaces in cities give way to concrete constructions and pesticides cause pollution, the sparrow has found it hard to survive.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The small-scale industrialist, Sajal Jugran, who has designed these boxes in Jaipur, says the extinction of house sparrows could lead to a &ldquo;takeover by insects&rdquo;.

Sports, falls, and motor-vehicle accidents account for the vast majority of injuries to the knee.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The different types of injuries to the knee are defined by the affected anatomy of the knee and the mechanism by which it's injured.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Knee sprains</strong> are injuries to the ligaments that hold the knee together. There are multiple ligaments that stabilize the knee and keep it in alignment. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) stabilize the knee in movement from front to back and cross each other in the middle of the <a class=\"imglink\" title=\"Medical Image\" href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/knee_joint_picture/picture.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"img\">knee joint</a>. The medial collateral ligament (MCL) and lateral collateral ligament (LCL) stabilize the knee so that the bones do not slide from side to side.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ligament sprains are graded by the amount of stretching or tearing of the ligament fibers and how much instability it causes as follows:</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Grade 1 knee sprain: The ligament is stretched and painful, but fibers are not torn and no instability is present.</li>\n<li>Grade 2 knee sprain: The ligament fibers are torn partially, mild instability may be evident.</li>\n<li>Grade 3 knee sprain: The ligament fibers are completely torn and the knee is unstable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Knee strains</strong> occur when tendons or muscles surrounding the knee are stretched, usually due to hyperflexion or hyperextension of the knee. These strains can lead to <a class=\"quizlink\" title=\"Learning Quiz\" href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"quiz\">pain</a> outside of the knee joint but can cause dysfunction of the normal range of motion of the knee. The patellar tendon stretches from the lower kneecap to the front of the tibia bone at the front of the leg.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Knee bursitis</strong> occurs when a fluid-filled pouch (called a bursa) in the knee is irritated, inflamed, or infected. Bursas are fluid-filled sacs located around joints that act as shock absorbers that minimize the friction between various tissues, such as the muscles and tendons around the joints. In the knee, there are two main bursas, one above the kneecap (<a class=\"imglink\" title=\"Medical Image\" href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/torn_meniscus_picture/picture.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"img\">patella</a>), and one below the knee joint near the front of the tibia bone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Tears of the meniscus</strong> can occur from damage to the inside of the knee. The medial and lateral menisci (plural of meniscus) are semi-round, articular cartilage that act as shock absorbers and smooth cushions for the thighbone (femur). These menisci can be injured acutely or can become dysfunctional gradually due to overuse and/or <a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/senior_health/article.htm\" rel=\"sub\">aging</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Knee joint dislocation</strong> can occur due to high-impact, large-force injuries to the knee (sports, motor vehicle accidents). This is a rare injury but causes severe damage to all the anatomical components of the knee and can include damage to the blood vessels and nerves about the knee. This requires emergency treatment or surgery.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The kneecap (patella) can dislocate to the side of the knee. Patella dislocation can be very painful but is generally not life-threatening and can be treated by popping it back into place (reduction of the patella), splinting, and physical therapy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Knee fractures</strong> occur from direct blows to the bones. Patella, or kneecap, fractures occur when a person falls directly down onto the knees and the kneecap cracks due to the force. Collapse of the top of the tibia bone in the knee (tibia plateau fracture) can occur from sudden compression injury to the knee, especially in people with <a class=\"slidelink\" title=\"Educational Slideshow\" href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/osteoporosis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"slide\">osteoporosis</a>. Other fractures of the long bones (fibula, tibia, and femur) are rare with isolated injures to the knee.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Other overuse injuries</strong> of the knee include patellofemoral pain syndrome (often referred to as \"runner's knee\") and <a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm\" rel=\"sym\">weakness</a> and degeneration of the cartilage under the kneecap (<a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/patellofemoral_syndrome/article.htm\" rel=\"dt\">chondromalacia patella</a>). These injuries are due to an accumulation of repetitive damage to the knee structures. This may be cause by either congenital problems or improper mechanics of the knee movement.<span id=\"cntid\">&nbsp;</span></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/knee1475996969922.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","publisherSectionName":"medicinenet.com","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"sprains"},{"text":"strains"},{"text":"bursitis"},{"text":"fractures"},{"text":"meniscus osteoporosis"},{"text":"knee sprains"},{"text":"knee bursitis"},{"text":"joint dislocation"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.medicinenet.com/knee_injury_and_meniscus_tears/article.htm","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T07:09:38.062Z","udate":"2016-10-10T04:43:27.259Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-10T04:43:00.000Z","publiseherSectionId":"57f7998d5c9c08595eb55a03","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9ed32f2efff597a396c6c","id":"57f9ed32f2efff597a396c6a","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out2184.mp3","tagsForSearch":"sprains,strains,bursitis,fractures,meniscus osteoporosis,knee sprains,knee bursitis,joint dislocation","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

{"_id":"57f9ee6e339bda5d32979a4a","title":"Face to face","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb900dea63af2cd0d814cf","content":"<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The art of portraiture does not command the same cachet it used to. As Goa-based curator Lina Vincent says, the pressing relevance of so many other things in contemporary times contrives to make portraiture look rather obsolete. Which is why artist Yusuf Arakkal&rsquo;s latest show, &lsquo;Faces of Creativity&rsquo;, is rather unusual. According to Arakkal, it is the first time an Indian artist has made such a comprehensive collection of portraits of fellow artists. There are 135 portraits &mdash; pen and ink drawings on reversed canvas, an unforgiving and challenging surface. Abanindranath Tagore (1871-1951) of the Bengal School is there as are artists from Arakkal&rsquo;s generation, and some younger.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Arakkal has deemed that the series will be one piece; to be sold to a single collector or institution. That is the reason why he will be launching a book with the same title so that &ldquo;the public will have a chance to see the portraits as a record of the greatest artists of our time&rdquo;.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The series assumes importance primarily because of its emphasis on faces. Even before he studied at the Karnataka Chitrakala Parishad in Bengaluru, Arakkal had received training in portraiture from Jaya Varma. &ldquo; He was a great European academic portrait painter, a product of the Royal College of Art, London,&rdquo; Arakkal recalls of his teacher, who was also a &ldquo;strict disciplinarian&rdquo;.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jaya Verma was the grand-nephew of Raja Ravi Varma, the famous 19th century artist from the princely state of Travancore, who enjoyed enormous patronage for his portraits. &ldquo;Ravi Varma&rsquo;s portraits,&rdquo; says Vincent, &ldquo;were done in the Western technique of oil colours and realistic perspective.&rdquo; Largely unsigned, as was the norm of Indian artists back then, the portraits that Ravi Varma made of royalty and divinity and of political leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak reflected the trend of overlapping the secular with the sacred, and politics with religion.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The 19th century also saw the trend of black-and-white photographs painted over and made into coloured versions with imagined elements added, like furniture, carpets or flower arrangements. According to Vincent, this distinctive technique became popular in the early 19th century and photographers like Raja Deen Dayal, who enjoyed the patronage of the Nizam of Hyderabad, created such handmade portraits, distinct from the existing colonial idea of realistic portraiture. Later on, artists like N.S. Bendre (1910-1991) would also depart from realistic portraiture. &ldquo;Even before the advent of photography in India, depicting people, royalty or otherwise, was very much a part of the aesthetics of miniature painting, whether Rajasthani or Mughal,&rdquo; says Vincent.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once the camera reached India in 1855, artists began using photographs as references for portraits. Abanindranath Tagore began to do stylised portraits and Rabindranath Tagore began to create psychological portraits, which turned countenance into character rather than a set of features. &ldquo;In turn, some of the best portraits of Rabindranath Tagore were done by British artist Sir William Rothenstein (1872-1945),&rdquo; points out Kolkata-based curator Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya. &ldquo;One can glimpse Tagore the thinker. His face reflects his character.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">After Independence, artists like Somnath Hore began to draw attention to social and political themes. For many artists, realism started to move towards abstraction. Iconic portraits began to emerge. This is when, according to Bhattacharya, one of the best examples of contemporary portraiture emerged &mdash; the fluid line drawings of Mahatma Gandhi. One significant body of work on the Mahatma came from South Indian artist K.M. Adimoolam (1938-2008) who depicted Gandhi&rsquo;s 60 years of lifeas black-and-white drawings in 1966.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gandhi became a favourite subject of artists across India. Vincent talks of a recent show of Goan artist Antonio Piedade Da Cruz&rsquo;s (1895-1982) art at Sunaparanta, Goa Centre for the Arts, which had a huge body of work celebrating Gandhi.&rdquo;</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bhattacharya urges viewers to look at Bikash Bhattacharya&rsquo;s (1940-2006) portrait of former prime minister Indira Gandhi. &ldquo;It is powerful imagery,&rdquo; he says. The same artist produced a series of works on the prostitutes in Kolkata&rsquo;s red light area as well as on the Naxal Movement.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Other significant portrait artists include Pestonjee Bomanjee (considered the Indian Rembrandt); Mukul Dey (1895-1989) &ldquo;look at his portrait of Rabindranath Tagore!&rdquo; Bhattacharya exults; Hemen Majumdar (1894-1948) whose iconic Lady with Lamp was stolen and found with an art dealer in 2002; and Sawlaram Haldankar, whose Woman with the Lamp is another familiar icon.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bollywood hasn&rsquo;t gone unrepresented, famously, of course, by M.F. Hussain&rsquo;s Madhuri Dixit series, but also by others like Vivek Sharma&rsquo;s portraits of Vidya Balan or Atul Dodiya&rsquo;s portraits from Indian cinema.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Arakkal is interested in the human figure. &ldquo;My travels to Europe and America gave me access to a lot of Western and African nationals,&rdquo; he writes in the curatorial note. &ldquo;This helped me understand various human characters.&rdquo; Adept at drawing the human form, Arakkal has been known to impart a painterly quality to his drawings. P. Sudhakaran, journalist and art critic, remarks in an essay that &ldquo;liveliness is the quality of Yusuf&rsquo;s drawings as a whole, which forms the backbone of even his much celebrated paintings&rdquo;.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The current show, however, has evoked mixed reactions, with some commentators pointing to the unlikeness of a few portraits to the subjects. And like some of the younger breed of contemporary artists like Jitish Kallat, Amit Bhar, T.M Aziz, and Samir Mondal, Arakkal too has used photographs as reference. He took three-four years to complete the series, almost like a creative aside from his other paintings, including the Christ series. The subjects are caught in the &lsquo;framed box&rsquo; in candid poses.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Vincent sums up the show by saying, &ldquo;Artistic interpretations should not be questioned. An artist should be given the liberty to express in ways that will not fit into everybody&rsquo;s expectations.&rdquo; And that is precisely the way one has to see this show.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>On View: Faces of Creativity: Sep 17-30, 10am-6pm, Varija Gallery, Dakshin Chitra, Chennai.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Jayanthi Madhukar is</em><em> a freelance writer </em><em>who believes that everything </em><em>has a story waiting to be old.</em></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/face14751280605541475997289756.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf66aebfe246bd8ebdfe5","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"face to face"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/jayanthi-madhukar-on-yusuf-arakkals-portrait-series-celebrating-indian-artists/article9140559.ece","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T07:14:54.437Z","udate":"2016-10-09T07:14:54.437Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T07:14:54.437Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-03T07:14:36.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9ee6e339bda5d32979a4c","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out5801.mp3","tagsForSearch":"face to face","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Troublingly, this threatens an already small pool: statistics gathered between 1994-2012 revealed that while 37% of the American population are people of colour, only 10% of books published focus on multicultural narratives.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Among the most commonly banned diverse books are works by Ernest J Gaines (The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman), Sherman Alexie (The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian), Toni Morrison (Beloved, The Bluest Eye, Song of Solomon) and many others.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Publishers such as Penguin Random House, Hachette Book Group, Bloomsbury, Scholastic, and Sourcebooks are supporting Banned Books Week by way of social media pushes and book giveaways; bookstores in cities throughout the country will host awareness events.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/BBW14752326450391475997364435.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57bab78473031e7ec856e982","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"this banned books week, reclaim your right to read all that you are denied"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.hindustantimes.com/books/this-banned-books-week-reclaim-your-right-to-read-all-that-you-are-denied/story-e4MkYV3XSC1EpbFiepiECO.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T07:16:09.087Z","udate":"2016-10-09T07:16:09.087Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T07:16:09.087Z","publishedOn":"2016-09-30T07:16:02.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9eeb9f807295d859fe92c","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out2482.mp3","tagsForSearch":"this banned books week, reclaim your right to read all that you are denied","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

{"_id":"57f9ef15f6280d58e8c2c428","title":"Let’s Restore Rhetoric","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb900dea63af2cd0d814cf","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">HE STOOD THERE not looking at the camera, sniffing but not smiling for the sake of us, more attack dog than dream builder. She, in red pantsuit, kept her smile&mdash;nervous or dismissive?&mdash;intact throughout, and delivered her America with the monotonous clarity of an experienced&mdash;good or bad?&mdash;policy wonk. Diction defined them. His: shorter, sharper, clearer, angry and accusatory. Hers: winding, calmer, and reassuringly status quoist. He raged against political hacks who let America fall, worried about the vanishing factories and jobs, tore apart all those horrible trade pacts, and vowed to make America great again, in spite of the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>. She sang inclusiveness and engagement, taxing the rich and reaching out. He called her unfit to be president: no stamina, and no temperament. She said she has both, but a globetrotting peacemaker could be seen fatigued occasionally. Both called each other a liar, attacked each other for being secretive. In their first presidential debate, the biggest media event (both conventional and social) before Election Day, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton danced on the shifting sands of language, leaving no footprints of authenticity or originality. And there was no mood-shifting &lsquo;there you go again&rsquo; sigh&mdash;an exasperated but jovial Reagan&rsquo;s response to an earnest but dull Carter in another debate in another time&mdash;either. They were trapped in their own trademark linguistic zones: he in the anti-politician&rsquo;s resentment; she in the establishment politician&rsquo;s triangulations.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As Barthes would have said, we are all wounded or seduced by language. It is what gives life a narrative beauty, and it is what makes the past accessible to the living. It is with the sound and structure of language that we measure our emotions, and relate to the other. It is what makes imagination immortal. You are what you say, and are we hearing a lot nowadays that denies our public life a rhetorical refinement? Are we missing the resonance of conviction, and the dignity of a counter- argument? Are we more &lsquo;wounded&rsquo; than &lsquo;seduced&rsquo; by the Ciceros of the day? Is the language of our politicians adding to the anxieties of our times? After all, it is eloquence powered by morality that makes the politician a winner, certainly in a democracy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A winner like Narendra Modi, at his best, won&rsquo;t miss a metaphor to gain easy access to the mind of his audience. He may have displayed remarkable restraint and then resolution worthy of our democracy in the aftermath of the Uri attack, but he has not abandoned poetry: blood and water can&rsquo;t flow together. Till May 2014, the prosody was masculine and combative; he was the lone outsider pitted against the establishment, and spoke in anger even as he sold hope. Today, it is the politics of anger that provides the alternative to the placid mainstream in the US and Europe; the outsider, the apolitical politician born in resentment and speaking in a language of fear and doom, is on the march. You are unlikely to hear a Theresa May say something like this: &ldquo;To those waiting with bated breath for that favourite media catchphrase, the U-turn, I have only one thing to say. You turn if you want to. The lady&rsquo;s not for turning&rdquo; (Margaret Thatcher). It is unlikely that Trump will be capable of saying what Barry Goldwater said in 1964: &ldquo;I would remind you that extremism in the defence of liberty is no vice. And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.&rdquo; There is a huge difference between Churchill&rsquo;s rhetorical flamboyance in the face of historical eruptions and the neo-Churchillian Boris Johnson&rsquo;s clever neologisms. Vajpayee&rsquo;s poetic flourish and Modi&rsquo;s lethal sonority don&rsquo;t have the same rhetorical effect on the stump. Indira Gandhi was Mother India to the core till her last speech: &ldquo;I do not care whether I live or die. I have lived a long life and I am proud that I spent the whole of my life in the service of my people. I am only proud of this and of nothing else. I shall continue to serve until my last breath, and when I die I can say that every drop of my blood will invigorate India and strengthen it.&rdquo; The grandson is still in search of a country that matches his ventriloquism.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">How has politics lost its rhetorical elan? That is what Mark Thompson, formerly the director-general of the BBC and currently President and CEO of the New York Times Company, asks in the finest book on political culture I read this year. <em>Enough Said: What&rsquo;s Gone Wrong with the Language of Politics?</em> (St Martin&rsquo;s Press, $ 27.99, 342 pages) could be a book-length, anecdotal, rhetorical variation of Orwell&rsquo;s seminal essay written 70 years ago. In the concluding paragraph of <em>Politics and the English Language</em>, Orwell wrote: &lsquo;Political language&mdash;and with variations that is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists&mdash;is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind. One cannot change this all in a moment, but one can at least change one&rsquo;s own habits, and from time to time one can even, if one jeers loudly enough, send some worn-out and useless phrase&mdash; some&nbsp;<em>jackboot, Achilles&rsquo; heel, hotbed, melting pot, acid test, veritable inferno</em> or other lump of verbal refuse&mdash;into the dustbin where it belongs.&rsquo; There is no redemption in politics as long as the language of politicians is an overused weapon of lies and evasions, even if we allow a certain amount of elegant exaggeration. Amplification has been part of rhetoric since Cicero, but, as Orwell, and now Thompson, says, no jargon please. The persuasive power of rhetoric is still achieved by the fine balance between argument (<em>logos</em>), character (<em>ethos</em>) and mood (<em>pathos</em>), but this Aristotelian guidance has no value for a political class empowered by clich&eacute;s and platitudes. &lsquo;Argument without character is lifeless. The crowd drifts away. Character without argument is dangerous. Who can tell what that spellbinding figure will actually do if those cheers are ever parlayed into real power? Ignore the mood of your audience and it&rsquo;ll ignore you right back. Make it your lodestone and you risk sailing yourself and them straight into the rocks,&rsquo; writes Thompson.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Still, restoration is not out of bounds. It begins with trust, the deficit of which in professional politics has contributed immensely to the rise of the anti-politician&mdash;the outsider playing up his native &lsquo;authenticism&rsquo;. Trust cannot be regained as long as the professional politician under-utilises the virtues of <em>ethos </em>and&nbsp;<em>pathos</em> and overuses amplification. &lsquo;Exaggeration is a drug. It delivers an instant high, but can have deleterious long-term effects&hellip; Indeed, exaggeration can become your trademark so completely that the media will always expect it of you and, unless you say something essentially unreasonable, will not report what you say at all.&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t we know? Here, Thompson, one of the finest journalists of his generation before he became America&rsquo;s most powerful print media executive, does not spare the media either. He is an advocate of mission-driven journalism, as it is being practised at the BBC and NYT, where objectivity and fairness are not yet redundant. A Donald Trump or a Nigel Farage may still ask: Is liberalism a bias or a virtue? Morality in public life is not a bias, certainly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My favourite line in this book is the least rhetorical: Let&rsquo;s teach our children rhetoric. Too late to tutor the lost tribe of professional pols about the morality of spoken words, but there is still time to train the next generation in the redemptive powers of language before we lose them to algorithms.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>The crisis in the language of politics</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Enough Said: What&rsquo;s Gone Wrong with the Language of Politics? | Mark Thompson | St Martin&rsquo;s Press | $ 27.99 | Pages 342</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/Locomotif1_714752405949811475997455953.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"let’s restore rhetoric"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/locomotif/let-s-restore-rhetoric","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T07:17:41.322Z","udate":"2016-10-09T07:17:41.322Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T07:17:41.322Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-01T07:17:34.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9ef15f6280d58e8c2c42a","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out3918.mp3","tagsForSearch":"let’s restore rhetoric","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

That&rsquo;s not all. The writer, whose books have sold two million copies around the globe, would also like to act in these films.&ldquo;If anyone asks me if I have experience acting, I would say that when I wrote my first book I never had any experience.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;So I could give acting a try,&rdquo; the author reveals in Kozhikode, where he met his fans on Thursday. If I don&rsquo;t get an opportunity, I would rather prefer Ranbir and Deepika, the best romantic pair of Bollywood, to enact the lead roles and Imtiaz Ali as the director.&rdquo; But these wishes are secondary, he adds. &ldquo;My focus is on writing more and keeping my readers satisfied,&rdquo; Ravinder says. This handsome writer had started off his career with leading IT establishments but his penchant for writing and an incident motivated him to become a full-time writer.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though Ravinder has visited Kerala only twice, he is so attached to the State, much more than any place he has been to. &ldquo;I have been to Ernakulam once and the very moment my flight landed, I could see beautiful green all around. The stay in the city was an awesome experience. I even postponed my trip to explore the city further. I would say Ernakulam and Kozhikode are two non- commercial hubs where you get to breathe a new lease of life every minute.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He was in Kozhikode to talk about his latest book &mdash; This Love that Feels Right. &ldquo;The definition of love is changing,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Today, if one&rsquo;s desires are not fulfilled with his/her partner, they start searching for it elsewhere. Having an extra marital relationship is very common these days. In other words, one starts having different partners for different expectations. The school of extra-martial affairs came into existence the very moment the concept of marriage took birth and hence, through my book I am questioning the hypocrisy surrounded over the concept of marriage.&rdquo;</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Asked if he was bothered by the tag of &lsquo;commercial writer&rsquo;, he says, &ldquo;With lots of pride, I would call myself a commercial writer.

Mani Valan S.J. As founder-director of the Centre for Christian Research (CCR) in Tiruchi&rsquo;s St. Joseph&rsquo;s College and professor with over 30 years&rsquo; of teaching experience, the Jesuit priest has made it his life&rsquo;s mission to archive ancient Tamil Christian literature through CCR.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In a way, the CCR&rsquo;s objective is understandable, because the history of printing in southern India is intertwined with its religious movements. Christian missionaries are considered to have pioneered the modern printing press in Tamil Nadu.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The credit of publishing the very first Tamil booklet goes to Portuguese Jesuit missionary Henrique Henriques. His <em>Thambiraan Vanakkam</em> (<em>Doctrina Christam en Lingua Malauar Tamul</em>) printed in 1577, in Goa, is a pamphlet of Roman Catholic catechism and considered to be the very first book printed not just in Tamil, but in any Indian language.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Scholar-missionaries like Roberto De Nobili, Bartholom&auml;us Ziegenbalg and Constanzo G. Beschi (more widely known as Veeramamunivar in south India), helped to revolutionise Tamil publishing in the following centuries.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why, then, does Fr. Mani Valan have to peep into dustbins to find rare Christian works in Tamil? &ldquo;Our people are not very interested in preserving books and manuscripts,&rdquo; explains Fr. Mani Valan, a bit ruefully.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before the advent of printing, Christian literature in the form of morality tales, biographies of saints, and hymn collections and so on, was being produced on palm leaf manuscripts.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Reading them requires special skill, because their inscribers left out the punctuation dots, apparently to preserve the brittle leaf base. &ldquo;Today, we need specialists to read these manuscripts. But earlier, even those who hadn&rsquo;t been to school were able to read them easily. So printing was just an addition to the knowledge base,&rdquo; says Fr. Mani Valan.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since its inception in 2009, CCR has reprinted 17 volumes of archival works, a majority of them taken from palm leaf manuscripts. Lemon oil and red cotton cloth wrappers are used to keep the fragile leaf manuscripts from crumbling.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fr. Mani Valan is on a quest to reprint 42 Christian epics, of which 20 have already been gathered.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Most people are reluctant to hand over these works even if they have no real use for them,&rdquo; says Fr. Mani Valan. &ldquo;Very often, families burn or destroy the palm leaf manuscripts and books when their owner dies.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Appealing to people to donate their unwanted literature is just one way that CCR sources its material. Shops selling old books are another source. But very often, as Fr. Mani Valan admits, the only way is to look for manuscripts in the bins of discarded printed matter. &ldquo;These torn and mutilated books are like abandoned children. I make it a point to visit libraries where stock is being cleared, because sometimes it is possible to find rare books in the dustbin,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As examples, he shows us a copy of Fr. Beschi&rsquo;s Tamil classic <em>Thembavani</em> (The Unfading Garland) issued by St. Joseph&rsquo;s College library in 1895 when it was functioning in Nagapattinam. &ldquo;I found it in a dustbin,&rdquo; he says. A more recent example he pulls out from the shelves is a Ph.D thesis on the Jesuit poet Gerald Manley Hopkins (1844-99) from the 1980s, also rescued from the trash.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the CCR widens its scope to include sections on arts, music, numismatics, stamps and architecture related to the Christian faith not just in Tamil, but in other languages as well, Fr. Mani Valan hopes the archive, which has been rated as an &lsquo;Institute of Excellence&rsquo;, will someday have its own premises. &ldquo;We would like CCR&rsquo;s publications to be easily accessible to students. At the same time, we could emerge as a platform for research scholars,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Man of letters</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fr. Mani Valan&rsquo;s interest in archiving religious literature was sparked off when his professor suggested that he should research the 1898 Biblical musical drama <em>Oothari Pillai Vilasam</em> (based on <em>The Prodigal Son</em>), written by Mariyadas, for his M.Phil thesis in 1992.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;It took me many months to find one copy of the book. That was when I realised that Tamil Christian literature was not being properly maintained,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Born in 1953 in the village of Ilayarasanendal, Tirunelveli district, Fr. Mani Valan showed an early aptitude for Tamil. When he was serving as professor and Vice-Principal at Loyola College, Chennai from 1988-1992, Fr. Mani Valan founded &lsquo;Veeramamunivar Ilakkiya Mandram&rsquo;, a forum to promote the correct usage of Tamil. From 1992, Fr. Mani Valan has been working in St. Joseph&rsquo;s College in various capacities (Controller of Exams, Director of PG Courses, Vice-Principal, Hostel Director, Deputy Principal, Library Director, among others), and though he retired in 2011, he continues to serve the institution, notably at CCR.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The clergyman is a noted poet in Tamil with several anthologies to his name. Some of his poems have been prescribed for school text-books and Civil Service exams.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also a musician, Fr. Mani Valan is assistant director, Summer School of Carnatic Music in Chennai, and trained under Rajappa Bhagavathar. He plays the keyboard and guitar, and has composed 40 songs.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He has also tried his hand at drama. <em>Puthiya Bethlehem Kuravanji</em> (The New Fortuneteller of Bethlehem), is a dance-drama that he adapted for Tiruchi&rsquo;s Kalai Kaveri College of Fine Arts from the original play by Vedanayagam Sastriar written in 1800.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I took 20 hours to write 14 songs for this play,&rdquo; recalls Fr. Mani Valan. &ldquo;The old version was more Sanskritised, I have updated it for younger audiences.&rdquo;</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/past14753047061261475997659426.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babcefb210157e920b07f9","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"preservation of the past"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/centre-for-christian-research-in-st-josephs-college-tiruchi/article9168327.ece","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T07:21:04.239Z","udate":"2016-10-09T07:21:04.239Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T07:21:04.239Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-01T07:20:31.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9efe0f807295d859fe946","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out1829.mp3","tagsForSearch":"preservation of the past","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

The stories have been translated by Prabha Sridevan)</h2>\n</div>\n<p class=\"body\">The buds of the moonbeam plants looked like white pearls. Seethalakshmamma smiled shyly as she plucked the open flowers. When the sun&rsquo;s rays touched the plants in the morning, the buds, like how sleeping babies would wake up, smile and stretch their heads, as if to say &ldquo;Me first&rdquo;, &ldquo;Me first&rdquo; competing with each other to adorn the divine <em>vigraha</em> of Sri Rama.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">As she plucked each flower, she would softly say Sri Rama or Krishna. The flowers, hidden amidst the leaves, waited with impatience, and smiled joyously when she moved the branches to see them. It seemed as if they said, &ldquo;We too are ready to serve Sri Rama.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\">Seethalakshmamma was especially happy that day&hellip; because her father had fixed her marriage. The sleeping buds within her were going to blossom too&hellip;.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">Suddenly she felt like hugging the moonbeam plants.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">How could she leave... this garden, the white buds, the <em>kolam</em> at the front of the house with its reddened edges, the moonbeam flowers adorning Sri Rama, the <em>tulsi</em> garlands, the flowering parijatam&hellip;? Above all, how could she leave her father&rsquo;s <em>tambura</em>, and his divine music which he sang in ecstasy with eyes closed? It seemed as if the flow of his devotion nurtured the daily household routine and even the rhythm of nature in this garden. She too was a tender sprout nourished by his devotion, but soon she would be transplanted elsewhere. Even before she had strung the garland of flowers, her heart sagged with the weight of this thought. She brought the small, wooden plank and set it down. She took the<em>tambura </em>that was resting on the plaster-cracked wall and placed it in front of the plank. As always, she strummed it once. The sound of its vibration was an indication to Appa that everything was ready for his<em>puja</em>. The fingers which had strummed the strings remained there without moving away. The half notes could be heard rejoicing amongst the basic notes in that extending vibration.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;What are you celebrating like this&hellip; my wedding&hellip; or my going away?&rdquo; Sadness filled her heart. She wished that the little droplets of her life would become one with these musical strains? The fingers slowly moved away from the <em>tambura</em> strings and gently stroked the smooth wood underneath. When she lifted her eyes, she saw Sri Rama in the <em>pooja mandapam</em>. A form that beautified the whole world, and as companions of this loveliness; Seetha <em>devi </em>on the left, and Lakshmana on the right, with Anjaneya bent in devotion&hellip; a divine scene.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">If the idol was so beautiful, how much more infinitely lovely would he have looked when he appeared as &ldquo;Bala kanakamayachela.&rdquo; Seethalakshmamma&rsquo;s heart asked this question constantly. That day too that question was present in the vibration of the <em>tambura</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">And as a half note to this, there was the other question&hellip;</p>\n<p class=\"body\">Would Appa never be satisfied? Sri Rama, his <em>ishta deivam</em>, had appeared before Appa in person...what more could he want? He had seen to his soul&rsquo;s satisfaction, the One whom he longed to see and pined for day and night&hellip;even if it was just for a moment&hellip; who else had ever been blessed with this divine sight?</p>\n<p class=\"body\">Appa had not gone to any temple, or a holy river nor had he ever gone on a pilgrimage. He had just remained in this small house chanting Rama&rsquo;s name unceasingly, and had daily offered Him a small garland and a portion of rice as <em>neivedyam</em>. That was all. Had not Vatsalaraman rushed to this doorstep in response to that? Should he not have attained peace at that very moment, with this as the answer to all his questions ? Instead he had sung, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have any compassion ?&rdquo; ( <em>Ela nee daya raadhu</em>?) Why?</p>\n<p class=\"body\">This was the question that Seethalakshmamma&rsquo;s heart asked gently every day, but she did not have the courage to ask Appa.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">But it could not be put off any more. She had to ask him that day. To leave this house without knowing the answer; would be more difficult than parting from this Raghukula tilaka. It was impossible. But she did not know how to ask him.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;Seethamma!&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\">Seethalakshmamma lost her balance a little when she stood up in haste on hearing her father&rsquo;s voice.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;Appa!&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;My child, what is it? Are you upset that you have to part from all this?&rdquo; He looked at her face tenderly.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;Mmm,&rdquo; It was a half-hearted assent.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">When he looked on at her face, she bent down.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;Sri Rama!&rdquo; Tyagayyar prostrated to Sri Rama, then picked up the <em>tambura</em>, set it on his lap and started strumming it.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;Appa.&rdquo; Seethalakshmamma interrupted him &mdash; something she had never done.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">His fingers, which had never stopped till the singing was over, halted mid-way.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;Tell me, Seethamma.&rdquo; His gentle eyes drenched her with affection.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;Did you really see Sri Rama, Appa?&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\">Tyagayyar set the <em>tambura</em> down.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;Why do you ask this question after such a long time. I truly saw Him. This is the truth as true as this pitch-pure vibration of this <em>tambura</em>. Are you satisfied?&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\">She had never heard her father speak so sharply. Her question had hurt him. But it was not doubt that lay behind her question. It was the preface, the preparation for what she wanted to know&hellip; the first step. Then she asked the question.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;How did He look&hellip; your Rama?&rdquo;</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\">&nbsp;</div>\n<p class=\"body\">This time Tyagayyar&rsquo;s response was not sharp.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;My child! Am I Valmiki or Kalidasa to describe that beauty? All I remember is that my eyes were filled with His grace. It opened all my heart springs, and made the flood of life fill and flow&hellip;&rdquo;As he spoke, the lean frame was eloquent with the inner bliss.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;Then&hellip;,&rdquo; softly asked Seethamma.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;Mmm... go on.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;The splendour and the experience of that sight must have made you feel that your life&rsquo;s purpose is fulfilled, no, Appa?&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;So true.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;Appa, if that is so, what are you still longing and pining for? Whether asleep or awake, you seem to be hopelessly immersed in the insatiable desire to see him again and again, and you are unable to shake that off. This world is populated by countless people and yet He chose you and you alone to reveal Himself. Instead of feeling fulfilled and content, you are torn and tormented by a restless longing. The songs that you create, and the music that you compose seem to be mere vehicles for that longing and craving. Even those occasional joyous songs seem to be born only from this yearning. Why should you have this longing when He on whom you have ceaselessly meditated, appeared before you on His own? This pining and thirst&hellip;do they not show an absence of Wisdom?&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\">Tyagayyar looked at Seethamma intently. Is this really a thirteen-year-old who is talking to him? No... this is actually the Goddess&hellip; the Piratti who has spoken from within her... it was Her sport!</p>\n<p class=\"body\">Tyagayyar looked at the Divine Couple smiling at him from the <em>pooja mandapam</em>. What radiance! Then he looked at his daughter.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;Seethamma! What shall I say? Shall I speak of your ignorance that makes you believe that your father is worthy of being a Gnani, or shall I speak of my ignorance in bringing you up to think so. It is all Sri Rama&rsquo;s doing!&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\">He stood up, and adjusted the <em>tulasi</em> garland on the idol. Then he opened out the petals of a lotus bud and placed it at the feet.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;My child, in this whole world, Sri Rama alone is perfect. All the others are imperfect and ignorant. It is true that He appeared before me out of His compassion. I have still not forgotten the sight of the four of them just as I see the four strings of this <em>tambura</em>. I still remain overcome by the completeness of that experience. The wavelets of that ecstasy break open the doors of my heart again and again. It is perhaps His will that there should be a permanent channel for this unquenchable thirst. That is why the flood of longing which breaks open from my heart flows out without my volition as lyrics, melody and rhythm. Amma, is it possible for me to compose all these <em>keerthanais </em>just by my effort? What did the Cosmic Creation&rsquo;s form and rhythm get reflected in the compositions? How did the rhymes emanate with the ease of a sunrise? Do you think I sang &ldquo;<em>Ela nee daya radhu,</em>&rdquo; after thinking and searching for words? It was Rama&rsquo;s command, and so the words came out as a release for my yearning. This yearning renews itself again and again and new songs are born, my dear.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\">Seethamma looked at her father who sat there limply with damp eyes and choked voice. She felt like drawing him close into her arms.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;Everything is ready for your <em>pooja</em>, Appa.&rdquo; She said in a low voice.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;There is one more question you have not asked, Seethamma.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\">And without waiting for her, he continued, &ldquo;If everything is dedicated to The Lord why should Appa mark every song with his signature &lsquo;Tyagaraja&rsquo;? Why haven&rsquo;t you asked me this question?&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;Appa&hellip;!&rdquo; Her face went pale. This was a thought that she had snipped away even before it was born, and it had now come out from him. Could he be said to be unwise?</p>\n<p class=\"body\">Tyagayyar continued firmly, controlling his surging emotions.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;If any error has crept into these songs which are really the result of divine inspiration, should not the world know that this man Tyagaraja is alone responsible&hellip; that is why I insert the name&hellip; And there is one more important reason.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;Every song is Sri Rama&rsquo;s abode of greatness. And I want to be there with him and be close to him. Now tell me, can there be a greater ignorance than this greed, and can there be a greater happiness than this ignorance?&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\">Seethamma bent down and sobbed softly.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;<em>Balakanakamaya chela sujana paripala,</em>&rdquo; Tyagayyar started singing, strumming the tambura.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">Seethamma wiped her eyes and joined him.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;<em>Ela nee daya raadhu,&rdquo; </em>the two voices joining&hellip; and singing&hellip; joining&hellip;and yearning&hellip;</p>\n<p class=\"body\"><em>Tyagaraja&rsquo;s daughter is Seethalakshmamma but the incident in Seetha Ravi&rsquo;s story is imaginary.</em></p>\n<p class=\"body\"><em>The three short stories were first published in Tamil in </em>Kalki<em>.</em></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/sm04_Tyagaraja_jpg_2570525g1475997730436.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf66aebfe246bd8ebdfe5","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"tyagaraja"},{"text":"seetha ravi"},{"text":"musical trinity"},{"text":"prabha sridevan"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/books/literary-review/keerthi-vilasam-by-seetha-ravi/article7719990.ece?theme=true","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T07:22:17.258Z","udate":"2016-10-12T07:28:21.775Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T07:13:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T07:12:00.000Z","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9f029b38e1d5d6a0c3c4e","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out3466.mp3","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"tagsForSearch":"tyagaraja,seetha ravi,musical trinity,prabha sridevan","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

These comments fill us with confidence, admiration and pride and we want it to happen to us again and again. But owing to a busy schedule and long working hours it might not be possible. Having said this, it does not mean that a person cannot stay intelligent throughout. This can be easily achieved by regular meditation. Regular meditation and yoga helps the mind to be more reflective and efficient.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here are reasons how yoga and meditation lead to an intellectual learning and growth:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Utilizes the brain:</strong> Almost everyone uses one half of their brain more and this leads to imbalance. Meditation is believed to sync the left and the right hemispheres, thereby allowing neural connection and great processing power. When logical left and creative right brains start working in harmony, then solving problems becomes easy; and it also increases creativity, deep thinking comes to be known of and concentration and focus magnifies. Highly successful people usually display whole brain synchronization.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Functional capabilities of brain enhance due to meditation:</strong> Research backs it that meditation increases the gray matter thickness of the brain regions, thus making the brain smarter, bigger and faster. This is very similar to doing physical exercise which makes the muscles denser and stronger. The increase in Functional Capabilities of brain is based on the concept of neuroplasticity, which states that our intelligence is not based on genetics and there are some things which can be done to improve the way our brain works. Meditation is a good brain enhancer with an ability to increase intelligence.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Beneficial brainwave patterns can be seen:</strong> Meditation can help to guide the brainwaves into beneficial frequencies. The frequencies: alpha, theta and delta when guided can show case a myriad of benefits including idea generation, creativity, cognitive functioning, and intellectual capacity. Meditation helps to transform these beneficial states of mind and help boost the IQ.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Develops intuition and insights:</strong> These are generally obtained through listening and developing to the inner voice. Thus meditation forms to be the basic key to tap these latent abilities. The intelligence can be mapped through tests and quizzes and is valuable at each level to stimulate insights and creativity. As per some people, inner intelligence, is considered to be the most important and best success in the world. Successful people including Steve Jobs have stated that their super revolutionary ideas and business acumen came through their intuition.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Meditation helps in improving both short and long term memory:</strong> The key memory areas hippocampus and frontal lobe show increase in activity during meditation. By stimulating these areas, the short and long term memories are improved.</li>\n</ol>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/iq1475997740226.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"579363ed4c0ab56541be1c26","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"yoga"},{"text":"meditation"},{"text":"fitness"},{"text":"health"},{"text":"brain"},{"text":"physical exercise"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"https://www.lybrate.com/topic/can-yoga-improve-your-iq-7fa1/7e56cdf04f91ae62d299cd60434421ba","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T07:22:28.867Z","udate":"2016-10-10T04:43:27.259Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-10T04:43:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9f0344a8d835943bd3a40","id":"57f9f0344a8d835943bd3a3e","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out4412.mp3","tagsForSearch":"yoga,meditation,fitness,health,brain,physical exercise","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

{"_id":"57f9f09ab38e1d5d6a0c3c5b","title":"A house for Mr. Gandhi","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb900dea63af2cd0d814cf","content":"<div class=\"articleLead\">\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the country remembers the Mahatma, the lesser-known Gandhian landmarks find themselves in varying degrees of neglect</h2>\n</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You can talk in English if you want,&rdquo; D.B. Jain, a laparoscopic surgeon, says to me, as I sit across his desk. &ldquo;Pani!&rdquo; he calls out. An attendant appears with glasses of cold water which he places in front of me and Ansar Ali, who works at the National Gandhi Museum (NGM). Ali has been trying to help me locate the house of another surgeon &mdash; Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari, one of the central figures of India&rsquo;s freedom movement. All we know is a possibly outdated address in Daryaganj and the fact that where Dr. Ansari&rsquo;s garden once stood is the Shakahar Hotel.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">On a quest to locate some of the lesser known sites associated with Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and the freedom movement, I discover that many of them are totally obscure, their preservation often left to chance.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">After much to and fro in our search, we zeroed in on Dr. Jain&rsquo;s gate. It was locked. Understandably cautious, he initially talked to us over the chained gate.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Later, sitting in his examination room, we learn that Dr. Jain now owns the house, his grandfather having bought it from Dr. Ansari&rsquo;s family. The house has hosted many significant meetings, as Dr. Ansari, a surgeon, was also a member of the Indian National Congress (INC) and its president in 1927. He had also served as president of the Muslim League and was one of the founders of Jamia Millia. The house&rsquo;s most famous guest was Gandhi, who met Dr. Ansari in 1915, through Sushil Kumar Rudra, the principal of St. Stephen&rsquo;s College. Gandhi would often walk, from this house, five miles to Viceroy House, and return to apprise the Congress Working Committee of his deliberations with Lord Irwin. These deliberations would eventually lead to the Gandhi-Irwin Pact of 1927.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr. Jain&rsquo;s grandfather, a municipal commissioner and contemporary of Dr. Ansari, has told his grandson of a time when Gandhi was very weak from a fast while staying at the house. When asked what ought to be done if he died, Gandhi said, &ldquo;Peeche jala diye (Cremate me at the back).&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr. Jain indicates with a movement of his hands that the story is possibly just family lore, but it is not unbelievable. Rajghat, where Gandhi was eventually cremated, vaguely fits that description in terms of its location relative from Daryaganj. What can be verified is Gandhi&rsquo;s secretary Pyarelal&rsquo;s documentation of an incident in 1933 when Gandhi was fasting in Pune and became critically ill. Gandhi sent a message to Dr. Ansari saying he would like &ldquo;nothing better&rdquo; than to die on the doctor&rsquo;s lap, to which the doctor said he would not let Gandhi die either on his or anyone else&rsquo;s lap.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nothing commemorates this landmark, which was once witness to momentous friendships, policies and debates central to the freedom movement. &ldquo;There was a plaque some time ago,&rdquo; Dr. Jain says. Dr. Ansari&rsquo;s property stays preserved otherwise only because of individual interest and some luck. It is to preserve and document similar sites, video and audio recordings, and documents related to the Mahatma that the Gandhi Heritage Sites Panel was formed. Headed by Gopalkrishna Gandhi, former diplomat, governor and Gandhi&rsquo;s grandson, the panel submitted its report to the government in 2008. It identified sites, both in India and abroad, including a core list of 39 sites, four of which are in London and South Africa.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Indian sites are, not surprisingly, scattered across the country, traversing its length and breadth as Gandhi himself did. From the one in Madurai, where Gandhi swapped his relatively elaborate Indian dress for the minimalist dhoti, to the dargah of Bakhtiar Chisti in the Mehrauli area of Delhi, which Gandhi visited days before his assassination. The Panel&rsquo;s main recommendations were to set up a Gandhi Heritage Mission to oversee the preservation of both the physical sites as well as documents and recordings related to Gandhi&rsquo;s life. The Panel also recommended the creation of a Gandhi Heritage Portal for digital preservation of documents and pictures. Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad was given charge of enabling the Mission&rsquo;s projects, which were to be funded from a corpus of Rs. 50 crore, and of creating and maintaining the portal.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As I walk up the mud path towards Sabarmati Ashram, I can hear the sounds of young voices. A class at the girls&rsquo; school of the Harijan Ashram Trust is in session and the children are reciting a lesson in Gujarati. I see a group of young people, likely from another country, walking down the path, some with matted hair, in tie-dye T-shirts and flip flops and with backpacks. A stray dog stares at me, its feet neatly placed on either side of tread marks made in the somewhat moist soil. It has rained recently. Construction workers walk in and out of some of the cottages. A man in a spotless white kurta pyjama stands at a gate in front of the cottages. Tridip Suhrud is the director of Sabarmati Ashram. He is a Gandhi scholar, not a Gandhian per se, he clarifies, during our conversation that morning. &ldquo;I do enjoy wearing a T-shirt and riding my bicycle every morning,&rdquo; he says. Suhrud got involved with the Ashram&rsquo;s administration more than a decade ago when the managing trust was looking for ways to reinvigorate the site.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;We started rebuilding the ashram around the portal&hellip; we saw it as an opportunity to reinvent ourselves,&rdquo; Suhrud says. The portal was launched in 2013.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">We walk across the road to the other side of the ashram. Today, the Sabarmati Ashram Preservation and Memorial Trust owns less than 2.5 acres of the original 80 acres purchased by Gandhi. The rest of the land is owned by associated trusts. Little white houses, with red tiled roofs, sit clustered across the road &mdash; these are inhabited by the Dalit families who joined the ashram when it was set up in 1917.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">One rainy night in 1917, Gandhi and his companions moved to Sabarmati Ashram in a convoy of bullock carts that made its way from the ashram at Kochrab, not 10 km away. The new ashram on the banks of the Sabarmati was not quite ready, but there was no time to waste. The plague had struck Kochrab. The piece of land that Gandhi had purchased for the new ashram happened to be located between a cremation site and a prison and Gandhi thought this was entirely appropriate since, according to him, a true <em>satyagrahi</em> would inevitably end up at one or the other. In 1922, Gandhi himself was His Majesty&rsquo;s guest at the jail in Sabarmati following his arrest for writing seditious articles in <em>Young India</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The jail and crematorium have been modernised and are functional. &ldquo;On a good day, you can even smell it,&rdquo; Suhrud says, laughing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gandhi used the ashram until 1930, when he and 78 followers embarked on the Salt March to Dandi. Thereafter, he disbanded it, partly in solidarity with thousands who had had their lands confiscated by the government.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">With one million visitors a year, maintaining the ashram infrastructure today is no mean task. With the reinvention came a research and climate-controlled archival centre, new job descriptions and even WiFi. Buildings designed by the celebrated Charles Correa have been renovated and some original structures such as the house of Gandhi&rsquo;s nephew Maganlal, who was the ashram&rsquo;s manager, and Hriday Kunj, Gandhi and Kasturba&rsquo;s house, are well preserved. Someone sits in Hriday Kunj, spinning continuously on the charkha as long as the ashram is open. Gandhi&rsquo;s room has a few of his original writing desks and the ubiquitous three monkeys. (I was to encounter no less than three sets of these during my travel, but I am still not clear which set is the original).</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Delhi, I visit the old St. Stephen&rsquo;s College at Kashmere Gate. It is now the office of Delhi&rsquo;s Chief Electoral Officer, Chandra Bhushan Kumar, who wants to build a museum on elections with a &lsquo;Gandhi Corner&rsquo; for which he has enlisted the help of the NGM. The building has a long relationship with Gandhi. When Gandhi, fresh from his successful experiments in South Africa, arrived in New Delhi on April 12, 1915, he stayed with Principal Rudra. He continued to stay there on his visits to Delhi through 1925. The Khilafat Movement was launched here and the Non-Cooperation Movement was &ldquo;conceived and hatched under his [Rudra&rsquo;s] hospitable roof,&rdquo; Gandhi wrote.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">I notice a few old structures &mdash; a staircase here, a shelf there. The Mission&rsquo;s experts are consulting the archives at St. Stephen&rsquo;s College to try and reconstruct the exact location of Gandhi&rsquo;s stay and his lecture to the students.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gandhi heritage sites in the public eye, controlled by robust trusts, tend to do well. Gandhi Smriti and Darshan Samiti (GSDS), Delhi, which runs an exhibition and archiving centre near Rajghat, and manages the former Birla House, is a case in point. Birla House, where Gandhi spent his final 144 days and where he was assassinated, is now a multimedia museum and a memorial to his last living quarters and the spot where he died. The place is well maintained and supports an ecosystem that extends beyond the physical space. The young guides are usually from disadvantaged backgrounds and are paid honorariums ranging from Rs. 13,000 to Rs. 16,000 per month. GSDS trains volunteers in eight different trades, including pottery, music and mime; some of them have gone on to lead programmes in Tihar Jail to train prisoners.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">But not all high-profile Gandhi heritage sites are as well-kept. In May 2016, <em>The Hindu&rsquo;s</em> Sunday Magazine reported that Pune&rsquo;s Aga Khan Palace, where Gandhi, Kasturba and Gandhi&rsquo;s secretary Mahadev Desai were imprisoned for the Quit India Movement, was dilapidated and in desperate need of repairs. Four months later, the situation is yet to be rectified.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;The building and garden are well maintained, but the museum is still in a shabby state,&rdquo; says Nilam Mahajan, who has been a guide at the museum for the past 36 years, over the phone. Suhrud says the Mission is awaiting a detailed project report to take the preservation ahead.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">India&rsquo;s 20th century heritage is especially vulnerable, says Anil Nauriya, a writer and Supreme Court lawyer. The Ancient Monuments Act enables the Archaeological Society of India (ASI) to protect monuments at least 100 years old, leaving newer monuments vulnerable.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dilkush, Sultan Singh&rsquo;s house where Gandhi ended his 1924 fast for Hindu-Muslim amity, is just one such example. In its place now, in the Subzi Mandi area of Delhi, stands an automobile spare parts shop. In the years after Partition, the priority was to resettle people and not preserve buildings, says Nauriya.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;When you preserve a structure and everybody passes by and they know what it signifies&hellip; it creates a new mindset in the person who sees it. It is a way of educating people.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Talking to people involved with Gandhi heritage work, it emerges that a PPP model for preserving privately-owned sites may be a good way forward.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the chairman of the Panel has observed, Gandhi &ldquo;impacted on the physical surroundings that he was in by engaging intensely with those venues, whether by tilling ground, raising cottages, cleaning them, being a prisoner in them, or investing them with the magnetism of voluntary starvation, prayer and, finally, of martyrdom.\"</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: right;\">-&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/sriram-lakshman/\">SRIRAM LAKSHMAN</a></span></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/gandhi14754782405391475997845751.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babcefb210157e920b07f9","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"a house for mr. gandhi"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/sriram-lakshman-on-the-state-of-some-landmark-gandhian-sites/article9173249.ece","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T07:24:10.472Z","udate":"2016-10-09T07:24:10.472Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T07:24:10.472Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-03T07:23:31.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9f09ab38e1d5d6a0c3c5d","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out5508.mp3","tagsForSearch":"a house for mr. gandhi","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

The&nbsp;<em>azaan</em>&nbsp;sounds. Two mynahs drink water from a mud basin. I would call it idyllic but the pretty and plump Sadia&rsquo;s large eyes are welling over. Married for five months and four months pregnant, the 22-year-old Sadia&rsquo;s husband suddenly wants a divorce. He wants her to abort the baby first because the Shariat doesn&rsquo;t let him divorce a pregnant wife. Shabana, also 22, has a pretty elfin face under thick glasses. Her husband says she is blind and has thrown her out with their 10-month-old son.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Noorjehan and Hazra <em>appa</em> listen, offer solutions, get angry. They are volunteers with Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA), and counselling is a major part of what they do. I am here with Zakia Soman, founder-chairperson of BMMA, which celebrates 10 years and one lakh members this year.</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Earlier that day, sitting in a cool, magenta-curtained room of her 10th-floor apartment, I had asked Soman what BMMA&rsquo;s most significant achievement in these 10 years was. &ldquo;For the first time since Independence, a progressive Muslim feminine voice has emerged,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;For far too long, the Muslim community has relegated the right to speak to a limited, conservative, patriarchal set who don&rsquo;t understand the times we are passing through; the challenges of liberalisation and technology.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">For women to wrest the Muslim pulpit is radical indeed. But Soman and BMMA have managed to do just that. Their latest victory came when the Supreme Court allowed women to enter the sanctum of Mumbai&rsquo;s famous Haji Ali shrine. &ldquo;Believe me,&rdquo; says Soman, voice low and eyes shining, &ldquo;on triple <em>talaq</em>too we will win. We will win not only because of the courts but because 50 to 60 per cent of the Muslim community supports us.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She speaks with the confidence of a leader and an idea whose time has come. A confidence bolstered by the countless men who now support BMMA. Her tone filled with pride, she says, &ldquo;They call us, mail us, tell us &lsquo;we are with you&rsquo;. They send us quotes from the Koran to support our views. I am inundated with mail.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Sachar Committee Report (2005) found that only an abysmal four of every 100 Muslims become graduates. Illiteracy appears to be the community&rsquo;s biggest hurdle, and Soman tries to explain why this is a particularly hard time. &ldquo;An already poor community is getting increasingly pauperised in the new economy.&rdquo; The average Muslim has traditionally worked in urban and semi-urban, multi-generational small businesses &mdash; shops, looms, garages, handicrafts, etc. &ldquo;The emphasis on education, the need for it has always been low. Couple this with the present climate. There&rsquo;s a psyche of insecurity and fear.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Soman should know. Her parents were academics, but just a generation ago, her grandfather was a mill worker. The lower middle-class joint family lived in a large home of four floors, many rooms and no locks. In a small, dark room upstairs, her grandmother and great aunts kept many cloth bundles, <em>potlas</em>. &ldquo;Much later, as an adult, I realised that these <em>potlas</em> contained all the family valuables. They were always packed, ready to be carried. As soon as there was a phone call, &ldquo;<em>shehar mein hullar hain</em> (there&rsquo;s uproar in the city),&rdquo; the women would pick up a <em>potla</em> each and start walking to the nearest safe area.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A community that had to be always ready to flee&hellip;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;In Ahmedabad,&rdquo; says Soman, &ldquo;there are many borders&hellip; not with another country but where a Hindu locality ends and the Muslim begins.&rdquo; I stare in disbelief. She laughs. &ldquo;We will go later to Jumhapura,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;a large Muslim ghetto. And to give you directions, they will say, &ldquo;come down this road and just before the border, turn left&hellip;&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Now I easily use words like Hindu, Muslim, border&hellip; words I have never used. This is our reality now. In that sense, we have lost a part of ourselves. But perhaps it will again be repaired because that too is part of our society; we are known for our resilience.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Soman has many stories, each one haunting. &ldquo;Many stories, many angles, all inter-connected. Then they dismiss it, saying we are all Indian, we are all one&hellip;&rdquo; With a flash of anger, she says, &ldquo;We too want it to be true. But it&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">During the 1969 communal riots of Ahmedabad, Soman was four. &ldquo;My grandmother and aunts all came to Jamalpur, where we lived. One image has stayed with me. When the curfew was lifted each morning, the women would go out to buy food. My mother took my brother and me to see our grandmother&rsquo;s house in Kallupur, on the border. And we saw my grandma&rsquo;s home completely ransacked &mdash; the single fan&rsquo;s blades had been twisted upside down. Cupboards, glasses, windows broken, lights torn down. We stood for a while, then walked back quickly. I remember my aunts and grandmother crying...</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Soman&rsquo;s absence of bitterness is striking. &ldquo;None of this entered my psyche. We were still mainstream. We studied in good schools, stayed with friends, friends stayed with us, we got good jobs&hellip; Of course, it is also a class thing, but when I look back, I don&rsquo;t agree with this demonisation of Gujarat. A kind of politics has been experimented with in Gujarat that has succeeded to an extent, but that does not mean all of Gujarat is or was like that; it&rsquo;s a mixed bag.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Despite his parents&rsquo; experience, Soman&rsquo;s father decided to buy a flat in what was largely a &lsquo;Hindu&rsquo; locality, Azad Society. &ldquo;Their friends said &ldquo;we will protect you&rdquo;. I realise now what a liberal man he was. This thing about Muslims not joining the mainstream &mdash; what more can a man do? We lived there for many years&hellip;&rdquo; Their friends did do their best but could not prevent their flat being burnt down in 1990 in the pre-Ayodhya riots. &ldquo;Everything was taken into the street and burnt. This broke my father. He finally moved to Paldi, a Muslim area.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Soman entered social work after 2002, when her husband and she were called to help families camping in a <em>kabristan</em> in Gomtipur. Married then to an abusive and violent man, Soman threw herself into helping the women she met in Gomtipur. It was to prove life changing.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I started talking to the women, helping them. But it was I who was being influenced by them. They were young. They were not educated like me. Afsana wanted to file a case, wanted compensation&hellip; Zubeida said: &ldquo;I will search for my husband as long as I am alive. Help me. Get me a curfew pass.&rdquo;</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">They all said, &ldquo;<em>Humko insaaf mil jaye to humko madad nahi chahiye</em>. (We want justice, not help.)&rdquo;</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">That was April 2002. Soman&rsquo;s marriage ended in April 2003. &ldquo;When I saw Afsana and Zubeida, I realised what it means to be alive. I was alive, I had everything. Why was I taking nonsense from this man? If these women, Class V dropouts, can fight, so can I.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Soman&rsquo;s husband divorced her using triple <em>talaq</em>, without a single rupee of <em>mehr</em>. &ldquo;The work I do with women now&hellip; I have been through all that. The Koran grants me fair maintenance, allows me to initiate divorce. But I didn&rsquo;t know this then. The <em>imams</em> keep all this under wraps.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Soon, Soman had met Noorjehan, her co-founder in BMMA, and many others. &ldquo;By 2006, we had arrived at a clarity. Muslim women were being shortchanged in personal life and as citizens. A few rabid, patriarchal men were speaking on the community&rsquo;s behalf. And they were talking rubbish. We felt the need to raise a voice.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">This clarity helped BMMA hone the ambition of its role. The founders saw themselves as citizens, women, Muslims, with no contradiction in these identities. They sought a larger sphere of influence, and soon realised their potential as community leaders.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As Soman says, &ldquo;We had by then given 60 years to the male leadership. It was time to build our own. BMMA would lead not only Muslim women, but the entire community.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The first major change they initiated was to work within both the Islamic and the Constitutional frameworks. &ldquo;The Muslim woman needs education, healthcare and jobs as citizen rights, but also gender justice within Islam.&rdquo; The second seminal move was to seek universality. So, they speak up not just for Muslim women, but for all marginalised communities. I tell Soman this is a significant stance. She agrees. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a declaration that we are mainstream.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">BMMA&rsquo;s bid to break the stranglehold of patriarchal leadership began strongly when it drafted its own legally-binding marriage contract (<em>nikkah namah</em>). Based entirely on the Koran, it makes the man declare any previous marriage. It lays down amounts for maintenance and <em>mehr</em> (a minimum that&rsquo;s equal to the husband&rsquo;s annual income). It eschews triple <em>talaq</em>. Soman gives me a copy and tells me that BMMA has conducted several marriages using this contract.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It&rsquo;s a much-needed move. <em>Mehr</em>, widely quoted to project Islamic personal law as &lsquo;progressive&rsquo;, is in reality a cruel joke. Most women are pressurised to declare <em>mehr maaf</em>, waiving of <em>mehr</em>. Or they are granted ridiculous amounts. Later that afternoon, Shabana told me her <em>mehr</em> was Rs. 2,500, a paltry sum her husband has refused to pay.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The key is to understand and interpret the Koran. So the organisation has started Qazi training for women, and has so far produced about 30 <em>qazis</em>. It has also started Auraton ki Shariat Adalat, or women&rsquo;s Shariat courts, which dispenses with divorce cases according to this gender-just reading of the Koran. There are four such courts and since 2014, it has handled 267 cases, of which all but 18 were successfully adjudicated. Do men have to be dragged screaming and kicking to these courts? &ldquo;Well, we do need to exert some pressure,&rdquo; Soman admits. Volunteers call, counsel, persuade, threaten and cajole; but often when the men realise it is Koranic, they are quite happy to accept the pronouncements.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">And that has been the magic formula. By sticking closely to the Koran, BMMA has managed to pull the rug out from under the conservative elements. Soman laughs: &ldquo;The Muslim personal law board is stumped. We are not going away from the Koran. We are delving deeper into it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In 2014, BMMA prepared the draft for a codified Muslim personal law, based both on Koranic and Constitutional values. Is this their response to the demand for a Uniform Civil Code? &ldquo;We prefer instead that the Muslim personal law first be codified to protect gender justice,&rdquo; she replies.

Eventually, the fatigued muscle transfers the overload of stress to the bone causing a tiny crack called a stress fracture.&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">What causes a stress fracture?</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most stress fractures are caused by overuse and repetitive activity, and are common in &nbsp;marathon runners and athletes who participate in running sports, such as soccer and basketball. &nbsp;They, often are the result of increasing the amount or intensity of running activity too rapidly. High impact loading during running leads to tibial stress fractures.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Where do stress fractures occur?</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />Runners can get a wide variety of stress fractures, but the most common stress fractures in runners are (in order) tibia (bigger shin bone),metatarsal, femur, fibula and navicular.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">What are the symptoms of a stress fracture?<br />The most common symptom of a stress fracture is pain. The pain usually develops gradually and worsens during weight-bearing activity. Other symptoms may include:</div>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Pain that diminishes during rest</li>\n<li>Pain that occurs and intensifies during running and also normal, daily activities</li>\n<li>Tenderness to touch at the site of the fracture</li>\n<li>Rarely &nbsp;bruising or swelling</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />How are stress fractures diagnosed?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">X-rays are commonly used to determine stress fracture. Sometimes, the stress fracture cannot be seen on regular x-rays or will not show up for several weeks after the pain starts. Occasionally, a computed topography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be necessary. A full medical work-up with laboratory tests to check for nutritional deficiencies such as low calcium or Vitamin D may also be required. &nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">How are stress fractures treated?</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />The goal of treatment is to relieve pain and allow the fracture to heal so that you are able to return to your running activities.. The majority of stress fractures are treated nonsurgically.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since stress fractures most often occur as a result of overuse, A period of rest is needed. Complete rest and a cast or walking boot are usually used for a period of four to eight weeks &nbsp;In addition to rest, shoe inserts or braces may be used to help these injuries heal. Calcium and vitamin D supplements often are prescribed.&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">With severe stress fractures, surgery may be needed for proper healing. Surgery would usually include placing pins, screws or plates to secure the bone during healing process.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to avoid stress fractures?</strong></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The following guidelines can help you prevent stress fractures in the future:<br />Eat a healthy diet. A balanced diet rich in calcium and Vitamin D will help build bone strength.</div>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Use proper equipment. Old or worn running shoes may lose their ability to absorb shock and can lead to injury. In general, athletic shoes should have a softer insole, and a stiffer outer sole. Consider rotating shoes to prevent future fractures.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Start new activity slowly. Gradually increase your time, speed, and distance. In most cases, a 10 percent increase in mileage per week is appropriate for most runners.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cross train. Vary your activities to help avoid overstressing one area of your body. For example, alternate a high-impact sport like running with lower-impact sports like swimming or cycling.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Add strength training to your workout. &nbsp;Strength-training exercises use resistance methods like free weights, resistance bands, or your own body weight to build muscles and strength.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Stop your activity if pain or swelling returns. Rest for a few days. If the pain continues, see your doctor.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Stride frequency is another factor that affects your impact and active forces. Higher stride frequencies and avoiding over-striding prevents stress fractures.</li>\n</ul>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/stress1475997966088.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babc1e73031e7ec856e9a3","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"dr k j reddy"},{"text":"apollo hospitals"},{"text":"stress fracture"},{"text":"fractures"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Health/2016-10-01/Stress-fractures-among-marathon-runners/256574","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T07:26:15.558Z","udate":"2016-10-10T04:43:27.259Z","expirydate":"2016-12-07T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-10T04:43:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9f117b547d25d4f55c12e","id":"57f9f117b547d25d4f55c12c","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6900.mp3","tagsForSearch":"dr k j reddy,apollo hospitals,stress fracture,fractures","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57f9f11ab547d25d4f55c132","title":"In the news no more","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb900dea63af2cd0d814cf","content":"<div class=\"articleLead\">\n<div class=\"articleLead\">\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</h2>\n</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was summer solstice, the longest day of the year, and one half of London&rsquo;s Fleet Street was awash in sunshine. Long shadows fell on the other. I could see St. Paul&rsquo;s looming large at the end of the street, but that could wait. It was Saint Bride&rsquo;s Church that I was looking for.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Famously called the Journalists&rsquo; Church, it is still dubbed the &lsquo;spiritual home of journalism&rsquo; in the United Kingdom. Still, because Fleet Street, once the hub of the newspaper industry in London and the U.K., is today just a term used collectively for the British press.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Street has gone pale for decades now, and in August, the last two journalists working on Fleet Street left the building. They had been working at <em>Sunday Post</em>, a DC Thomson publication, which lately closed its London offices.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darryl Smith, a Fleet Street journalist with 25 years of experience, and Gavin Sherriff, with over 30 years of work, became celebrities. After all, they were the last two to leave the Street, which has a history that dates to the Roman era.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was in the early 16th century that the Street became associated with the printed word. Wynkyn de Worde, a publisher and printer, set up the first printing press on Fleet Street in the yard of St. Bride&rsquo;s Church. Why the church, you wonder? Simple. Fleet Street was where the clergy, among the most literate of all classes, lived.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As I stepped into St. Bride&rsquo;s Church, all was quiet. There was an exhibition in the Crypt, and what an eye-opener that turned out to be. The Crypt itself was discovered after the Church was bombed during the time of the Blitz (World War II) and the floor of the church was destroyed. The Crypt was excavated in 1953, and it is said that many skeletal remains of those who perished during the Great Plague of the 17th century are contained there.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are old gravestones, coffins and some engravings and sketches worth a look. One of the exhibits that caught my attention was the front page of <em>The Evening News</em> with headlines about the bombing of the church.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Having taken in the history of the church, I continued walking on the Street to stop at a blue plaque &mdash; the first London and English daily newspaper <em>The Daily Courant</em> was published in a house near the plaque way back in 1702. The first issue of the <em>Courant</em> was brought out on March 11 that year. That marked the beginning of the newspaper industry on the Street.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">My next stop was the famous Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese pub that came with huge recommendations. This historic pub, the signage says, was rebuilt in 1667, making it among the oldest in London. The pub finds mention in <em>A Tale of Two Cities</em> as does Fleet Street. Stepping in, I found a dark entrance lit by golden lamps, a fireplace and wooden benches. I ordered my ale and walked down to the cellar full of surprises &mdash; old wooden barrels, caskets and vintage bottles all adding charm to the place. To think this was the pub that Sydney Carton leads Charles Darnay to &ldquo;down Ludgate-hill to Fleet Street, and so, up a covered way into a tavern.&rdquo; Travel guides invariably recommend a visit to this pub, and although Fleet Street hacks perceive it as &ldquo;touristy&rdquo;, the pub is a great experience. I, for one, loved the fries that came wrapped in paper reminiscent of old newsprint.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Talking about pubs and Fleet Street, you can&rsquo;t help but talk of Michael Frayn&rsquo;s definitive Fleet Street novel, <em>Towards the End of the Morning</em> (first published in 1967). In his introduction, Frayn writes of how the Street &ldquo;had its own characteristic smell&rdquo;. &ldquo;I can catch the delicious ghost of it in my nostrils now, and at once I&rsquo;m back at the beginning of my career, struggling to conceal my awe and excitement at having at last arrived in this longed-for land.&rdquo; He goes on to say that it is not just the smell of newsprint that the Street signified, but the &ldquo;warm beery breath from doorways with titles above them as familiar as the mastheads on the papers themselves...&rdquo; Every paper had its own go-to pub, according to Street experts. Printer&rsquo;s Devil for <em>The Mirror</em>, King and Keys for <em>Telegraph</em>, and so on.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">For Sherriff, who calls himself the last Fleet Street chief reporter, the go-to pub was always Cock Tavern. Over email, he tells me, &ldquo;I remember my early days when all the pubs were full of journalists exchanging gossip. Today we do this via Facebook, Twitter, etc.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ask Smith, the other journalist who said goodbye to Fleet Street, about his favourite pub, and he reveals, &ldquo;It will probably make some of the old journalists who worked on the Street in the past 314 years choke on their real ale if they knew that one of the last two journalists on the famous old Street never had anything stronger than a lager shandy. That said, I did like The Punch Tavern, just because of the history of the place. It has been open 200-odd years (at least) and still has the same frontage as you walk in. I love the history of some of the buildings on Fleet Street. When you see old photos you can make out all the same buildings today, even if they are now sandwich bars, bistros and financial institutions.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">During my walk on the Street, I stopped at an address that said 72-78 Fleet Street (Chronicle House). It is now full of offices; wealth management firms, recruiters, and costs lawyers, among others. I went online and found an old image that says Chronicle House was marked as a public air raid shelter during World War II.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">But change is at the heart of all life, and Fleet Street is no exception. After all, River Fleet, which gives the Street its name, is today just a sewer. The character of the Street has seen constant flux, and naturally so. No man ever steps into the same Street twice, for it&rsquo;s not the same river and he&rsquo;s not the same man, with apologies to that great philosopher Heraclitus.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Savitha Karthik is a freelance journalist, blogger and content writer </em><em>based out </em><em>of Bengaluru.</em></p>\n</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/fleet14754791691801475997974227.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf66aebfe246bd8ebdfe5","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"in the news no more"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/fleet-street-bids-adieu-to-the-last-two-journalists/article9172733.ece","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T07:26:18.568Z","udate":"2016-10-09T07:26:18.568Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T07:26:18.568Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-03T07:25:37.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9f11ab547d25d4f55c134","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out5118.mp3","tagsForSearch":"in the news no more","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57f9f1694a8d835943bd3a65","title":"Parimala Ranganathar","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8f88ebfe246bd8ebd873","content":"<div class=\"articleLead\">\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is the second of three short stories by Seetha Ravi on the musical trinity of Syama Sastri, Tyagaraja and Muthuswami Dikshitar. The stories have been translated by Prabha Sridevan</h2>\n</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pundarika Valli is fortunate, very, very fortunate.&rdquo; A smile blossomed on Anandan&rsquo;s face as soon as this thought came to him.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pundarika Valli&rsquo;s place next to Parimala Ranganathar was not the result of good fortune, actually that nearness and that position were hers by right permanently. Do we celebrate Ranganatha&rsquo;s good fortune that he holds the disc and the conch? No. So also Pundarika Valli&rsquo;s place beside him was hers by right as was her loveliness.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;But her real good fortune is that she has been adorned by <em>Hamirkalyani</em>,&rdquo; thought Anandan. He heaved a long sigh tossed by these mixed emotions, and it seemed to him that Parimala Ranganathar&rsquo;s broad chest too rose and fell. In the outer <em>mandapam</em>, his <em>Gurunathar</em> was sleeping with blissful exhaustion like a mother who had delivered a child born of a wonderful, spiritual and physical union. Near his head the veenai mutely waited brimful with unborn music. This veenai was also fortunate like Pundarika Valli. It had been embraced by the wavelets of Ganga and the strings had been stroked by the fingers of this Jeevanmuktha.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">His touch resulted not in some commonplace tune but in melting fluid harmony. This music was shaped out of the stirrings of one&rsquo;s very life. But if there was only one life, can it be melted and shaped again and again? Is it possible to construct temples of melody, with majestic words and heavenly music for The Divine Dancer, Ranganatha, Abhayamabika, Kamalambika, Saraswathi, Kandha and Ganapathi? Each<em>keerthanai </em>was the endeavour of a soul, the fruit of a lifetime. Wasn&rsquo;t this too a state of self-realisation?</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Anandan felt that it was so. Though his <em>Gurunathar</em> had surrendered to this worldly life, he was not ensnared in its coils and so he wandered freely from place to place. And everywhere the music kept flowing on.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even before he reached a town or village the residents knew of his arrival, perhaps the wind whispered to the leaves of the trees, &ldquo;Muthuswami Dikshitar is coming.&rdquo; The people would wait for him with garlands and <em>purnakumbham</em>. A house decorated with <em>kolam</em>, and illuminated by lamps, would be made ready for him. A cow with a calf would be brought and tied there. The parrots and the koels seated on the trees vied with each other in a musical contest.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The heavy wooden box carrying the <em>pooja</em> articles was Anandan&rsquo;s responsibility. He had hammered two big rings on both sides of the box, so that one could push wooden rods through them and carry the box like a palanquin. The idols would stand inside undisturbed while Anandan and three others carried the box.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">His <em>Gurunathar</em> never had any planned schedule for his travel; he would just set off as his mood dictated. Until he actually started, the <em>pooja </em>could not be disturbed. So the last persons to join the entourage would always be Anandan and his three palanquin-bearing companions.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Should not the marks on the shoulders caused by bearing the palanquin, be identical on all the four? But that was not so. When they immersed with delight in the Kaveri, Anandan noted that the mark on his shoulder was one finger-width deeper and broader than the marks on the others. His joy at the thought that this mark was the reward for his sense of duty and devotion exceeded the delight of the Kaveri<em>snanam</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He looked at the sleeping one again. The face looked peaceful, and the entire frame indicated the deep calm. The slanted feet looked like folded lotuses. Anandan went and sat next to them. Unthinkingly, his right hand gently stroked the mark on his left shoulder. Inside the box were the sturdy Gajamukha, the Mahameru made of <em>panchaloha </em>together with the Goddess, the Arumuga on the peacock, with his twelve eyes saying &ldquo;Fear not&rdquo; and his beautiful arms, the peacock daintily turning back to see his radiance, and then the <em>pooja</em> articles all added to the weight on Anandan&rsquo;s shoulders. Anandan&rsquo;s joy too multiplied. But this joy prevented him from experiencing another thrill.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">His <em>Gurunathar</em> composed a song at every sacred spot that he went to, mhmm&hellip; truly the songs kept emanating from him. Lately at Mayuram, he had composed ten <em>vibhakti keerthanais</em> about Abhayambikai. He had set Mayuranathar like a gem in Danyasi. Abhayambikai and Mayuranathar will eternally remain where they are at Mayuram, but their fame carried by his master&rsquo;s songs would spread throughout the world. Just as he bore the <em>pooja </em>box with his proud devotion, his Guru&rsquo;s other disciples who carry the music in their hearts and their voices will make the <em>keerthanais </em>known to all&hellip;.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Anandan&rsquo;s disappointment was not because he did not sing the <em>keerthanais</em>; he knew he was not one of those who could grasp at once what is taught. Vadivelu, Ponnayya, Sivanandam and Kamalam were all extraordinarily talented. And what to say of Thambiyappan and Tirukkadaiyur Bharathi. They would absorb what they heard just like the sunbeam drinks each dewdrop. Anandan did not have that talent. When he heard the music, he was enslaved, and stunned by its majesty, he became mute. The lyrics and the melody flooded his heart and flowed out as tears. But mere tears cannot preserve the art. If<em>Gurunathar</em>&rsquo;s creations had to be immortalised and move the listeners forever, then the ones who learnt them today must not dissolve in tears. They must internalise the music with both heads and heart and have the skill to spread them. Anandan was happy that there were such persons. But because of his inability, he could not be near his Master. He had to be physically away, because he had to make the<em>neivedhyam</em> and <em>pooja</em> ready. So till date he was never a witness to the wonderful moment when the song was born.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most of the times, his Master would have already composed the song about the Principal Deity or the accompanying one, as Anandan entered the village with the <em>pooja</em> box. The residents would welcome him with the news of the creation, and describe it with thrilled hearts and with moist eyes.<em>Sankarabharanam </em>or <em>Kalyani </em>or <em>Kambodhi</em>... they may not even know the <em>raga</em>. But they would say ecstatically &ldquo;He came, saw our deity and a song was born.&rdquo; Anandan and his companions would lay down their burden and all they could do was listen to this.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is not that he resented listening to it. Every time it happened, his respect and devotion for his<em>Gurunathar</em> increased. But at the same moment, the regret that he was not present at that moment of creation grew and engulfed him.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">What would it be like?</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">When the words and the melody held within the confines of grammar burst out of the creator as life-force, what was it like? Would it be like the rain-bearing clouds which pour down unable to withhold any longer? Or would it be like the moment when the sun ray touches a lotus and it opens and flowers? How can songs each unique be born again and again at the moment of inspiration, like waves rushing to embrace the earth again and again?</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The question how tormented him. The persons who had seen and heard it say this and that&hellip; &ldquo;his face was resplendent like the moon, his eyes shone like stars while he sang&rdquo;. To Anandan it seemed that the Master always appeared like that. When he sang, he worshipped and he ate&hellip; and here even now when he was sleeping... but how would it be at the moment of creation and unless one experienced it how would you know? Unless one touched the flame, one would not know how it sears. How does one know... understand?</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The tragedy was that the occasion to know and to understand how never arose. Anandan&rsquo;s eyes filled with longing and unknown to him they fell as tears on the folded lotuses that were the Master&rsquo;s feet.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Ananda,&rdquo; Muthuswami Dikshitar startled awake and like a young child sat up.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Are you crying?&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Anandan shook his head indicating &ldquo;No&rdquo;, but said &ldquo;Yes, Swami.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Gurunathar</em>&rsquo;s hand gripped his shoulder, and the mark on it felt the touch.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What is this? Is it because you have been carrying the deities constantly?&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He nodded his head in assent. The Master looked at him as if to ask, &ldquo;It must have made you happy?&rdquo; and wiped the tears which flowed from Anandan&rsquo;s eyes.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;This Pundarika Valli is very fortunate, Swami&rdquo; and his tears increased when he described how she had been with adorned with <em>Hamirkalyani</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Sivanandam and Ponniah sang it this afternoon&hellip; the <em>keerthanai </em>you have composed to extol Parimala Ranganathar. Swami, you have captured the entire sweep of <em>Hamirkalyani </em>in one single word &lsquo;Pundarikavallinatham&rsquo; in the <em>pallavi</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;No Anandaa... <em>Hamirkalyani </em>is a perennial spring. I have just drawn a small vessel full, that is all. I have heard the <em>ustads</em> in the North, where it will sparkle like stars strung together and hung as a decoration&hellip;. Here in our temples it acquires the sanctity of the lamp&rsquo;s glow.&rdquo;</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Swami, did you see Her face shine with a special radiance in the glow of the new lamp that you lighted? The face of the Goddess shines like a moon, and rightly so for this place is Tiru Indalur. And Parimala Rangan who has just woken keeps gazing at her. Come, see them Swami.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He virtually dragged the Master. Smiling, the Master walked on with him.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Parimala Rangan is Veerasayanan, Anandaa. He will always be awake.

{"_id":"57f9f1d74a8d835943bd3a81","title":"A visit to Roald Dalh's childhood in Cardiff","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb900dea63af2cd0d814cf","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Cardiff\">Cardiff</a> is now known more for footballer Gareth Bale, following his perfor mance in Euro 2016, the Welsh capital is also the <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/birthplace\">birthplace</a> of Roald Dahl. This is also the year that marks the celebrated author's birth <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/centenary\">centenary</a>. For this occasion, the whole city has been turned on its head to give life to Dahl's popular characters.<br /><br />While most are aware of Dahl's Welsh connections, I pick an unusual trail -tracing Dahl's childhood link to Cardiff. I begin by hopping onto a bus to explore the legacy of one of Wale's literary legends in Landaff, in the outskirts of Cardiff. The 30-minute-bus ride takes me to the center of the leafy suburb where there's little that pertains or speaks of Dahl. I spot the tall Landaff Cathedral at a distance, which is the town's only landmark. I ask around for Dahl's home. Dahl -a best-selling author of children's books such <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/James-and-the-Giant-Peach\">James and the Giant Peach</a>, <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Charlie-and-the-Chocolate-Factory\">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a>, Matilda, <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/The-Witches\">The Witches</a>, <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/The-BFG\">The BFG</a>, <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/The-Twits-and-George's-Marvellous-Medicine\">The Twits and George's Marvellous Medicine</a>, along with short stories for adults such as the Tales of the Unexpected -was born in Landaff in 1916.<br /><br /><strong>Ty Gwyn (Vila Marie)</strong><br /><br /><img class=\"gwt-Image\" src=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/54640518.cms\" /><br /><br />Like many of Dahl's stories that have unexpected twists, everyone I checked with pointed at a different direction, during my quest to uncover his childhood. Not many knew about Dahl's Landaff connection. Finally, after a fair bit of wandering around the bylanes of the town, an elderly lady guides me to Ty Gwyn, a quaint-but-freshlypainted house on Fairwater Road.&ldquo;It's the prettiest house on the block, you won't miss it,&ldquo; she added. Her description wasn't far from the truth, and soon I spotted a stunning white house peeking out behind the bushes. The house has an enclosed courtyard, double oak front doors and a traditional three turn staircase leading to a galleried landing. Called Vila Marie then, it is here where Dahl was born. I step inside the compound to check if I could meet Dahl's family. But I'm informed that the house was sold in 2013 for &pound;1.4 million. Many locals believe that experiences in Llandaff were among the pivotal influences that shaped Dahl's imagination that would sell more than 100 million books.<br /><br />From Ty Gwyn, I walk along the road back to the cathedral where I came across Cathedral School, which Dahl first attended in 1923.The all-boys preparatory school overlooked the Cathedral Green, which used to be a stone building during Dahl's student life, and is now a group of houses, located in the centre of Llandaff village.<br /><br /><strong>Mrs Pratchett's Sweet</strong><br /><br /><img class=\"gwt-Image\" src=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/54640612.cms\" /><br /><br />Shop At the school gate, I'm directed to a Chinese takeaway along the road.By appearance, it could pass for one of the many Chinese takeaways that dot every town in the UK. On the fa&ccedil;ade of the eatery, I spot a blue plaque that read, `Site of Mrs Pratchett's sweetshop'. It dates back to Dahls's time at Cathedral School, as mentioned in his autobiography, Boy: Tales of Childhood (1984). At the age of eight, he and his four friends (one named Thwaites) were caned by the headmaster for dropping a dead mouse in a jar of gob stoppers at the local sweet shop, which was owned by a &ldquo;mean and loathsome&ldquo; old woman called Mrs Pratchett. I craved to indulge in some Gobstoppers, Strawberry Bonbons and Tonsil Ticklers that must've caught Dahl's fancy at the sweet shop on Llandaff High Street.I was disheartened to find that the menu at the Great Wall Chinese Takeaway, which occupies the space at present, had a completely different offering.<br /><br /><strong>Elmtree House School</strong><br />Taking me a few years back in time is the next stop on the Dahl trail.It's the Elmtree House School, where Dahl attended kindergarten.This is now a private house on Palace Road, so Dahl's fans are requested to respect the family's privacy. When Dahl lived in Cardiff, this was a pre-preparatory school. He attended the institution, along with his sisters Alfhild, Else and Asta. In Boy, he notes that it's &ldquo;astonishing how little one remembers&ldquo; of his early years. But what did stay with him was the fact that it was here that he learnt to tie his shoelaces, the journeys to and from school and even the &ldquo;excitement&ldquo; of a new tricycle.<br /><br />I can only imagine Dahl as a child, riding across the steep pavements on his tricycle. &ldquo;I can remember oh so vividly how the two of us [his eldest sister] used to go racing at enormous tricycle speeds down the middle of the road. I do have a blurred memory of sitting on the stairs and trying over and over again to tie one of my shoelaces, but that is all that comes back to me at this distance of the school itself,&ldquo; Dahl said in his autobiography which states that he left this school at the age of seven.<br /><br /><strong>Cumberland Lodge</strong><br />I walk back towards the bus stop since I can hardly spot anyone to ask for directions. It begins to drizzle and joggers with headphones race past. An old man walking his Cocker Spaniel stops and enquires if I need help. &ldquo;Roald Dahl, Cumberland Lodge,&ldquo;I ask. Walk straight down the road, he instructs. After a few minutes, I spot the Howell's School nursery. After struggling to get in on a Sunday, I'm told that this is the location that once used to be Cumberland Lodge. In February 1920, Dahl's older sister Astri died at the age of seven from an infection following a trying struggle with appendix. A few weeks later, his father, Harald passed away as well. In Boy, Dahl recounts: &ldquo;[Astri's] sudden death left him literally speechless for days afterwards. He was so overwhelmed with grief that when he himself went down with pneumonia a month or so afterwards, he did not much care whether he lived or died.&ldquo; At the time of her husband's death, Sofie was pregnant and already had five children. It was then that she moved the family back to Llandaff to a smaller home called Cumberland Lodge. He describes the house as a &ldquo;medium-sized suburban villa&ldquo;.<br /><br /><strong>Landaff Cathedral And Hill</strong><br />As I head back, I decide to check out the town's most impressive building -one that lends its name to the town itself, Landaff Cathedral. The Anglican cathedral was frequented by Dahl as a kid on his way to school. The huge cathedral door was shut and there was no one around. As I was about to walk away, the door squeaked and I turned around to see the caretaker greeting me with a welcoming smile. He pointed me to the lush green fields towards the west, where Dahl cycled. I braved the rains to walk through a dense cover of trees. In Boy, he recounts being very impressed by a certain 12-year-old boy free wheeling on his bicycle down this hill. The cyclist was pedalling backwards with no hands on the 8 handlebars. The seven-year-old witness to this event vowed that one day he would also cycle down the steep hill the same way.<br /><br /><strong>National Museum</strong><br />My next stop is the National Museum in Cardiff, where I got acquainted with the works of Quentin Blake, best known for his illustrations in Roald Dahl's books. The exhibition showed the origins of some of Blake's most iconic and popular creations including The Twits and Danny, the Champion of the World. His first roughs sketches and storyboards, many of which were never made public, were on display.<br /><br /><strong>Norwegian Church</strong><br /><img class=\"gwt-Image\" src=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/54640570.cms\" /></p>\n<div class=\"last8brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<div class=\"sponsor_block clearfix loaded\">\n<p>Dahl was born to Norwegian parents and was christened at the Norwegian church, which affords spectacular sights of the Cardiff Bay. The bay happens to be Cardiff's most buzzing and scenic location, with a myriad of caf&eacute;s. I spotted the church (now called the Norwegian Church Arts Centre) from a distance, located at the tip of the pier.The Roald Dahl gallery upstairs has on display works by local artists. Along the quay is Roald Dahl Pass, an open space that's home to Wales Millennium Centre. Not too far from here is where nine-year-old Dahl would set off for boarding school in Weston-super-Mare across the Bristol Channel, travelling from Cardiff Docks via an old steamer.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"last7brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">While in Cardiff Bay, I couldn't help but walk through the Roald Dahl Plass. It was in 2002 that this plaza was renamed from the Oval Basin in honour of the author.The plaza is home to huge events in its own right, but when isn't hosting any events, it is the entrance to two iconic city buildings -the Senedd and Wales Millennium Centre. At the Millennium Center, you can see The Wondercrump World of Roald Dahl -and interactive exhibition of Dahl's works.</div>\n<div class=\"last5brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"last5brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Boy, he says: &ldquo;On a clear day, you can stand on the esplanade at Weston and look across the fifteen or so miles of water and see the coast of Wales lying pale and milky on the horizon.&ldquo;</div>\n<div class=\"last3brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"last3brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Licking Cadawalader's, the Welsh coffee and ice-cream chain's bubblegum ice-cream, I try to visualise what Dahl saw. It's not a clear day and I can barely see the boats at a distance against the setting sun. This scenic sight at Cardiff Bay seems like a perfect way to conclude my Dahl trail which was as surreal as his works.</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/images14754855842871475998162085.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baa979cabe7a5704419047","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"a visit to roald dalh's childhood in cardiff"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/books/features/A-visit-to-Roald-Dalhs-childhood-in-Cardiff/articleshow/54640379.cms","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T07:29:27.793Z","udate":"2016-10-09T07:29:27.793Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T07:29:27.793Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-03T07:27:04.000Z","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9f1d74a8d835943bd3a83","tagsForSearch":"a visit to roald dalh's childhood in cardiff","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

One day he decided to host an extravagant feast for the gods, such a feast as never had been hosted before. It would increase his prestige and show all men and gods the extent of his wealth and influence. <br /><br />Accordingly, he went to Mount Kailash to invite Lord Shiva. Shiva was his patron. Kubera owed all his wealth to Shiva who, pleased with his devotion had given him the boon that his wealth would never diminish, no matter how much he spent. <br /><br />Shiva declined to come but said he would send his son, Ganesha. Kubera was disappointed. Shiva's presence would have been a feather in his cap. But at least he was sending Ganesha. It would have been a terrible snub if no one from the family were to come. Kubera resolved to make the feast so grand that Shiva's absence would not be felt.<br /><br />The guests were many, thousands of them, both gods and men. They were accommodated in a huge hall built especially for the purpose. The chief guest, Ganesha, was the last to come. <br /><br />The moment he entered, he began to ask for food. He was shown to a seat of honor and tantalizing dishes were set before him. He gulped them down and asked for more. He was given a second helping and then a third but his appetite remained undiminished. <br /><br />Kubera ordered his army of cooks to produce more food but they could not keep pace with Ganesha's eating frenzy. The elephant-god was eating food meant for thousands. When he had finished all the food set before him, he began to shout, \"Give me more, give me more!\" and then getting impatiently to his feet, rushed to the enormous kitchen and devoured all the food there. <br /><br />Kubera was aghast. All the food was gone and the guests had not been fed. Worse, Ganesha was still hungry. <br /><br />\"You call this a feast?\" Ganesha admonished Kubera. \"There's no food here. I'm going home.\" <br /><br />Kubera pleaded with him to stay, promising him more food in a little while but his young guest was in no mood to listen. He got on his mount and sped away. Kubera, fearing Shiva's wrath, followed in his own vehicle. When he arrived at Kailash, he found Ganesha complaining loudly to his father about the lack of food at his feast. <br /><br />\"What's this I hear, Kubera?\" asked Shiva, turning to the god. \"No food at your feast?\" <br /><br />\"I....I....,\" mumbled Kubera. <br /><br />\"Go in and ask your mother for some food,\" said Shiva to his son. \"I'm sure Kubera did his best.\" <br /><br />\"I did, I did, my lord,\" said Kubera, feeling miserable. His feast had turned into a farce. Instead of adding to his prestige it had made him a laughing stock. But he was relieved to see that Shiva did not appear to be angry. <br /><br />He fell at his patron's feet and begged forgiveness for his pride.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/KuberasFeast1475998762131.gif","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","publisherSectionName":"http://www.english-for-students.com","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"hindu mythology"},{"text":"kubera"},{"text":"shiva"},{"text":"ganesha"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.english-for-students.com/Feast-of-Kubera.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T07:39:28.693Z","udate":"2016-12-17T10:51:47.678Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T07:37:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T07:37:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","publiseherSectionId":"57f9f43075f31263314a87a4","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57f9f43075f31263314a87a3","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out7909.mp3","audioImageUrl":"","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"tagsForSearch":"hindu mythology,kubera,shiva,ganesha","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Everywhere Winston goes, even his own home, the Party watches him through telescreens; everywhere he looks he sees the face of the Party&rsquo;s seemingly omniscient leader, a figure known only as Big Brother. The Party controls everything in Oceania, even the people&rsquo;s history and language. Currently, the Party is forcing the implementation of an invented language called Newspeak, which attempts to prevent political rebellion by eliminating all words related to it. Even thinking rebellious thoughts is illegal. Such thoughtcrime is, in fact, the worst of all crimes.</p>\n<p>As the novel opens, Winston feels frustrated by the oppression and rigid control of the Party, which prohibits free thought, sex, and any expression of individuality. Winston dislikes the party and has illegally purchased a diary in which to write his criminal thoughts. He has also become fixated on a powerful Party member named O&rsquo;Brien, whom Winston believes is a secret member of the Brotherhood&mdash;the mysterious, legendary group that works to overthrow the Party.</p>\n<p>Winston works in the Ministry of Truth, where he alters historical records to fit the needs of the Party. He notices a coworker, a beautiful dark-haired girl, staring at him, and worries that she is an informant who will turn him in for his thoughtcrime. He is troubled by the Party&rsquo;s control of history: the Party claims that Oceania has always been allied with Eastasia in a war against Eurasia, but Winston seems to recall a time when this was not true. The Party also claims that Emmanuel Goldstein, the alleged leader of the Brotherhood, is the most dangerous man alive, but this does not seem plausible to Winston. Winston spends his evenings wandering through the poorest neighborhoods in London, where the proletarians, or proles, live squalid lives, relatively free of Party monitoring.</p>\n<p>One day, Winston receives a note from the dark-haired girl that reads &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; She tells him her name, Julia, and they begin a covert affair, always on the lookout for signs of Party monitoring. Eventually they rent a room above the secondhand store in the prole district where Winston bought the diary. This relationship lasts for some time. Winston is sure that they will be caught and punished sooner or later (the fatalistic Winston knows that he has been doomed since he wrote his first diary entry), while Julia is more pragmatic and optimistic. As Winston&rsquo;s affair with Julia progresses, his hatred for the Party grows more and more intense. At last, he receives the message that he has been waiting for: O&rsquo;Brien wants to see him.</p>\n<p>Winston and Julia travel to O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s luxurious apartment. As a member of the powerful Inner Party (Winston belongs to the Outer Party), O&rsquo;Brien leads a life of luxury that Winston can only imagine. O&rsquo;Brien confirms to Winston and Julia that, like them, he hates the Party, and says that he works against it as a member of the Brotherhood. He indoctrinates Winston and Julia into the Brotherhood, and gives Winston a copy of Emmanuel Goldstein&rsquo;s book, the manifesto of the Brotherhood. Winston reads the book&mdash;an amalgam of several forms of class-based twentieth-century social theory&mdash;to Julia in the room above the store. Suddenly, soldiers barge in and seize them. Mr. Charrington, the proprietor of the store, is revealed as having been a member of the Thought Police all along.</p>\n<p>Torn away from Julia and taken to a place called the Ministry of Love, Winston finds that O&rsquo;Brien, too, is a Party spy who simply pretended to be a member of the Brotherhood in order to trap Winston into committing an open act of rebellion against the Party. O&rsquo;Brien spends months torturing and brainwashing Winston, who struggles to resist. At last, O&rsquo;Brien sends him to the dreaded Room 101, the final destination for anyone who opposes the Party. Here, O&rsquo;Brien tells Winston that he will be forced to confront his worst fear. Throughout the novel, Winston has had recurring nightmares about rats; O&rsquo;Brien now straps a cage full of rats onto Winston&rsquo;s head and prepares to allow the rats to eat his face.

It is aimed at ensuring that even if a manufacturer of any essential medicine wants to discontinue production, the drug remains in supply till consumers find an alternative.<br /><br />For instance, the guidelines say if a drug has a market share of more than 10% and less than 20% and its manufacturer wants to stop selling it in India, the regulator will allow gradual discontinuation but the company will have to continue selling the medicine for at least nine months and not reduce production by more than 40%.<br /><br />For more commonly used medicines, <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/NPPA\">NPPA</a> has asked companies to continue selling such drugs for at least a year. In case of medicines with more than 50% of market share, the regulator will examine on a case-to-case basis and decide on merit.<br /><br />&ldquo;NPPA will also explore the possibility of alternative arrangements to supplement the production gap likely to be caused by such withdrawal by referring the matter to DoP (Department of Pharmaceuticals) to request the government PSUs to produce such drugs,&ldquo; the guidelines said.<br /><br />The regulator has also asked companies to follow the price cap imposed on essential medicines till the time they are allowed a complete discontinuation and an alternative is available in the market.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />The guidelines follow reports on discontinuation of many <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/essential-drugs\">essential drugs</a> after the government's stringent measures to keep prices low. While the pharmaceutical pricing policy does not allow companies to discontinue production of medicines without a six-month prior notice, companies often inform the government and then increase prices. The regulator said that in such cases companies will be fined for overcharging consumers.</p>\n<div class=\"last6brdiv\">However, the guidelines also have a provision to allow companies a price hike after detailed investigation if that is the reason for discontinuation.&nbsp;</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/images_(3)1476002881666.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf990af76df6bbfd6b63e","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"nppa"},{"text":"essential drugs"},{"text":"medicines"},{"text":"drugs"},{"text":"the national pharmaceutical pricing authority"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/Essential-drugs-cant-be-stopped-suddenly/articleshow/54623081.cms","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T08:48:09.092Z","udate":"2016-10-10T04:43:27.259Z","expirydate":"2016-12-01T16:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-10T04:43:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fa0449cf43e76842714a1a","id":"57fa0449cf43e76842714a18","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out7968.mp3","tagsForSearch":"nppa,essential drugs,medicines,drugs,the national pharmaceutical pricing authority","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned:</p>\n<p>&mdash;<em>Introibo ad altare Dei</em>.</p>\n<p>Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:</p>\n<p>&mdash;Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!</p>\n<p>Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.</p>\n<p>Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly.</p>\n<p>&mdash;Back to barracks! he said sternly.</p>\n<p>He added in a preacher's tone:</p>\n<p>&mdash;For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One moment. A little trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.</p>\n<p>He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points. Chrysostomos. Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm.</p>\n<p>&mdash;Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off the current, will you?</p>\n<p>He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages. A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.</p>\n<p>&mdash;The mockery of it! he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!</p>\n<p>He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck.</p>\n<p>Buck Mulligan's gay voice went on.</p>\n<p>&mdash;My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a Hellenic ring, hasn't it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself. We must go to Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid?</p>\n<p>He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:</p>\n<p>&mdash;Will he come? The jejune jesuit!</p>\n<p>Ceasing, he began to shave with care.</p>\n<p>&mdash;Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.</p>\n<p>&mdash;Yes, my love?</p>\n<p>&mdash;How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?</p>\n<p>Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.</p>\n<p>&mdash;God, isn't he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous Saxon. He thinks you're not a gentleman. God, these bloody English! Bursting with money and indigestion. Because he comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus, you have the real Oxford manner. He can't make you out. O, my name for you is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.</p>\n<p>He shaved warily over his chin.</p>\n<p>&mdash;He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. Where is his guncase?</p>\n<p>&mdash;A woful lunatic! Mulligan said. Were you in a funk?</p>\n<p>&mdash;I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. Out here in the dark with a man I don't know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther. You saved men from drowning. I'm not a hero, however. If he stays on here I am off.</p>\n<p>Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.</p>\n<p>&mdash;Scutter! he cried thickly.</p>\n<p>He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen's upper pocket, said:</p>\n<p>&mdash;Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.</p>\n<p>Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief. Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly. Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:</p>\n<p>&mdash;The bard's noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen. You can almost taste it, can't you?</p>\n<p>He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly.</p>\n<p>&mdash;God! he said quietly. Isn't the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet mother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. <em>Epi oinopa ponton</em>. Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you. You must read them in the original. <em>Thalatta! Thalatta!</em> She is our great sweet mother. Come and look.</p>\n<p>Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown.</p>\n<p>&mdash;Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.</p>\n<p>He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen's face.</p>\n<p>&mdash;The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That's why she won't let me have anything to do with you.</p>\n<p>&mdash;Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.</p>\n<p>&mdash;You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you, Buck Mulligan said. I'm hyperborean as much as you. But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her. And you refused. There is something sinister in you....</p>\n<p>He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. A tolerant smile curled his lips.</p>\n<p>&mdash;But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. Kinch, the loveliest mummer of them all!</p>\n<p>He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.</p>\n<p>(Contd...)</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/ulysses_4301476002995354.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","publisherSectionName":"Project Gutenberg","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"ulysses"},{"text":"james joyce"},{"text":"stream of consciousness"},{"text":"great novels"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4300/4300-h/4300-h.htm","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T08:50:02.739Z","udate":"2016-12-17T09:51:49.853Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T08:45:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T08:45:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","publiseherSectionId":"57fa04ba2040d36ae07b708b","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fa04ba2040d36ae07b708a","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out5615.mp3","audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"ulysses,james joyce,stream of consciousness,great novels","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

After analysing data from 25,100 South Korean men and women, one in seven of whom had detectable levels of coronary artery calcium (CAC) -- an early sign of coronary heart disease or potential blood clots -- the team found that the level of CAC was highest among those who had less than one cup or more than five cups of coffee daily, but lowest among those who drank between three to five cups.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"st_readmore_sp\">Coffee may reduce the risk of multiple sclerosis</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The findings of a US and Swedish study which compared more than 1,000 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) to a similar number of healthy people suggested that individuals who drink four to six cups of coffee daily may be less likely to develop the disease. When compared to those who drank at least four to six cups of coffee per day during the year before symptoms appeared, those who did not drink coffee had about a one and a half times increased risk of developing MS, with similar protective effects also seen among those who drank large amounts of coffee five to 10 years before symptoms appeared.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"st_readmore_sp\">Coffee can improve erectile dysfunction</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A study by the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston found that men who drank two to three cups of coffee a day were less likely to have erectile dysfunction (ED).

Opting for Vitamin C enriched products or taking cocoa or mulberry can do the talking for your skin.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sangeeta Velaskar, Vice President and Head, Medical Services and R&amp;D, Kaya Limited, throws light on a few ingredients that one must look out for before opting for the next facial:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>* Vitamin C:</strong> The antioxidant properties of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and its role in brightening make vitamin C a vital molecule for skin health. Dietary and topical ascorbic acid have beneficial effects on skin cells and studies have shown that vitamin C may also help prevent and treat ultraviolet (UV)-induced photo damage</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>* Cocoa:</strong> Free radicals are the reactive forms of oxygen generated when UV light hits the skin. It is well established that the ageing of the skin caused by sunlight is largely the result of damage to the skin&rsquo;s proteins caused by these free radicals. Cocoa is packed with antioxidants that help repair skin cells and neutralize harmful free radicals</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>* Seaweed:</strong> Seaweed&rsquo;s natural, anti-inflammatory compounds can have a positive effect on acne explosions by reducing the swelling. It can also be used as a natural exfoliant to remove dead skin cells, which can block pores. Seaweed, when applied to the body, draws excess fluid and waste products from the skin. It also acts as a cleanser for dead skin cells and other impurities on the surface</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>* Arbutin:</strong> Arbutin is a molecule extracted from the bearberry plant that prevents the formation of melanin. One of the benefits of alpha arbutin is that it lightens dark skin at a fast pace and gets rid of melasma spots. Arbutin also blocks tyrosinase and keeps dark spots at bay</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>* Mulberry:</strong> Men and women often look to mulberries to treat dry, blotchy and aging skin. Even sensitive skin can be safely rejuvenated with mulberry treatments, supplements and juices. The vast antioxidant properties remove toxins, unclog pores, even skin tone, moisturize and fight blemishes. The same properties also help promote healthy hair growth, produce shine and luster, and prevent breakage and loss of colour vibrancy</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/skin1476003729817.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baaa06250c0156ce7311e9","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"skin"},{"text":"vitamin c"},{"text":"sangeeta velaskar kaya limited"},{"text":"cocoa"},{"text":"seaweed"},{"text":"arbutin"},{"text":"mulberry"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/fashion/festive-season-skin-care-beauty-tips-with-natural-ingredients-for-healthy-glowing-skin-3058694/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T09:02:18.031Z","udate":"2016-10-10T04:43:27.259Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-10T04:43:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fa079a2040d36ae07b70fa","id":"57fa079a2040d36ae07b70f8","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","tagsForSearch":"skin,vitamin c,sangeeta velaskar kaya limited,cocoa,seaweed,arbutin,mulberry","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

{"_id":"57fa09bad0e65a6a84b32f5b","title":"PRIDE AND PREJUDICE","subtitle":"Jane Austen","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fa234a4ac2d218b1a52","content":"<p>The news that a wealthy young gentleman named Charles Bingley has rented the manor of Netherfield Park causes a great stir in the nearby village of Longbourn, especially in the Bennet household. The Bennets have five unmarried daughters&mdash;from oldest to youngest, Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia&mdash;and Mrs. Bennet is desperate to see them all married. After Mr. Bennet pays a social visit to Mr. Bingley, the Bennets attend a ball at which Mr. Bingley is present. He is taken with Jane and spends much of the evening dancing with her. His close friend, Mr. Darcy, is less pleased with the evening and haughtily refuses to dance with Elizabeth, which makes everyone view him as arrogant and obnoxious.</p>\n<p>At social functions over subsequent weeks, however, Mr. Darcy finds himself increasingly attracted to Elizabeth&rsquo;s charm and intelligence. Jane&rsquo;s friendship with Mr. Bingley also continues to burgeon, and Jane pays a visit to the Bingley mansion. On her journey to the house she is caught in a downpour and catches ill, forcing her to stay at Netherfield for several days. In order to tend to Jane, Elizabeth hikes through muddy fields and arrives with a spattered dress, much to the disdain of the snobbish Miss Bingley, Charles Bingley&rsquo;s sister. Miss Bingley&rsquo;s spite only increases when she notices that Darcy, whom she is pursuing, pays quite a bit of attention to Elizabeth.</p>\n<p>When Elizabeth and Jane return home, they find Mr. Collins visiting their household. Mr. Collins is a young clergyman who stands to inherit Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s property, which has been &ldquo;entailed,&rdquo; meaning that it can only be passed down to male heirs. Mr. Collins is a pompous fool, though he is quite enthralled by the Bennet girls. Shortly after his arrival, he makes a proposal of marriage to Elizabeth. She turns him down, wounding his pride. Meanwhile, the Bennet girls have become friendly with militia officers stationed in a nearby town. Among them is Wickham, a handsome young soldier who is friendly toward Elizabeth and tells her how Darcy cruelly cheated him out of an inheritance.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of winter, the Bingleys and Darcy leave Netherfield and return to London, much to Jane&rsquo;s dismay. A further shock arrives with the news that Mr. Collins has become engaged to Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth&rsquo;s best friend and the poor daughter of a local knight. Charlotte explains to Elizabeth that she is getting older and needs the match for financial reasons. Charlotte and Mr. Collins get married and Elizabeth promises to visit them at their new home. As winter progresses, Jane visits the city to see friends (hoping also that she might see Mr. Bingley). However, Miss Bingley visits her and behaves rudely, while Mr. Bingley fails to visit her at all. The marriage prospects for the Bennet girls appear bleak.</p>\n<p>That spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte, who now lives near the home of Mr. Collins&rsquo;s patron, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who is also Darcy&rsquo;s aunt. Darcy calls on Lady Catherine and encounters Elizabeth, whose presence leads him to make a number of visits to the Collins&rsquo;s home, where she is staying. One day, he makes a shocking proposal of marriage, which Elizabeth quickly refuses. She tells Darcy that she considers him arrogant and unpleasant, then scolds him for steering Bingley away from Jane and disinheriting Wickham. Darcy leaves her but shortly thereafter delivers a letter to her. In this letter, he admits that he urged Bingley to distance himself from Jane, but claims he did so only because he thought their romance was not serious. As for Wickham, he informs Elizabeth that the young officer is a liar and that the real cause of their disagreement was Wickham&rsquo;s attempt to elope with his young sister, Georgiana Darcy.</p>\n<p>This letter causes Elizabeth to reevaluate her feelings about Darcy. She returns home and acts coldly toward Wickham. The militia is leaving town, which makes the younger, rather man-crazy Bennet girls distraught. Lydia manages to obtain permission from her father to spend the summer with an old colonel in Brighton, where Wickham&rsquo;s regiment will be stationed. With the arrival of June, Elizabeth goes on another journey, this time with the Gardiners, who are relatives of the Bennets. The trip takes her to the North and eventually to the neighborhood of Pemberley, Darcy&rsquo;s estate. She visits Pemberley, after making sure that Darcy is away, and delights in the building and grounds, while hearing from Darcy&rsquo;s servants that he is a wonderful, generous master. Suddenly, Darcy arrives and behaves cordially toward her. Making no mention of his proposal, he entertains the Gardiners and invites Elizabeth to meet his sister.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, however, a letter arrives from home, telling Elizabeth that Lydia has eloped with Wickham and that the couple is nowhere to be found, which suggests that they may be living together out of wedlock. Fearful of the disgrace such a situation would bring on her entire family, Elizabeth hastens home. Mr. Gardiner and Mr. Bennet go off to search for Lydia, but Mr. Bennet eventually returns home empty-handed. Just when all hope seems lost, a letter comes from Mr. Gardiner saying that the couple has been found and that Wickham has agreed to marry Lydia in exchange for an annual income. The Bennets are convinced that Mr. Gardiner has paid off Wickham, but Elizabeth learns that the source of the money, and of her family&rsquo;s salvation, was none other than Darcy.</p>\n<p>Now married, Wickham and Lydia return to Longbourn briefly, where Mr. Bennet treats them coldly. They then depart for Wickham&rsquo;s new assignment in the North of England. Shortly thereafter, Bingley returns to Netherfield and resumes his courtship of Jane. Darcy goes to stay with him and pays visits to the Bennets but makes no mention of his desire to marry Elizabeth. Bingley, on the other hand, presses his suit and proposes to Jane, to the delight of everyone but Bingley&rsquo;s haughty sister. While the family celebrates, Lady Catherine de Bourgh pays a visit to Longbourn. She corners Elizabeth and says that she has heard that Darcy, her nephew, is planning to marry her. Since she considers a Bennet an unsuitable match for a Darcy, Lady Catherine demands that Elizabeth promise to refuse him. Elizabeth spiritedly refuses, saying she is not engaged to Darcy, but she will not promise anything against her own happiness. A little later, Elizabeth and Darcy go out walking together and he tells her that his feelings have not altered since the spring. She tenderly accepts his proposal, and both Jane and Elizabeth are married.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/download1476004274989.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","publisherSectionName":"sparknotes.com","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"jane austen"},{"text":"pride and prejudice"},{"text":"best novel"},{"text":"family drama"},{"text":"romance"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/pride/summary.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T09:11:22.044Z","udate":"2016-12-17T10:01:50.302Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T09:10:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T09:10:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","publiseherSectionId":"57fa09bad0e65a6a84b32f5e","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fa09bad0e65a6a84b32f5d","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6002.mp3","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"jane austen,pride and prejudice,best novel,family drama,romance","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Gatsby&rsquo;s enormous mansion is adjacent to Carraway&rsquo;s modest home, and Carraway becomes curious about his neighbor after being invited to one of his famous parties.&nbsp; Nick soon learns that Gatsby is in love Daisy Buchanan, Nick&rsquo;s cousin and the wife of one Tom Buchanan, an acquaintance of Nick&rsquo;s from Yale. Buchanan takes his old friend for a day in the city, where Nick learns that Buchanan has a kept woman, Myrtle, the wife of a long island mechanic.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"center\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gatsby sends a message through he and Nick&rsquo;s mutual friend, professional golfer Jordan Baker, insisting that Nick plan a &ldquo;chance&rdquo; meeting for Gatsby and Daisy. Nick learns that Gatsby, Jay Gatz at the time, and Daisy had once been in love, but Daisy married Tom while Gatsby was in Europe during the Great War.&nbsp; In the aftermath of this, Jay Gatz abandoned his old identity, becoming Jay Gatsby and amassing a fortune with the help of notorious criminal Meyer Wolfsheim.&nbsp; Gatsby chose the site of his house in Long Island because it was across the bay from Daisy&rsquo;s house, from which a green light could be seen at night.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"center\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nick manages to get Gatsby and Daisy together, and while the meeting is awkward at first, Gatsby soon relaxes and invites Nick and Daisy back to his mansion.&nbsp; Gatsby and Daisy begin to see each other secretly with some frequency.&nbsp; Nick and Gatsby also become close, as Nick is one of the only people who continues to support Gatsby despite the myriad rumors that circulate around the man.&nbsp; Buchanan eventually confronts Gatsby in Manhattan about the affair, and the two argue at length about who it is that Daisy genuinely loves. Daisy claims to love both of them, but she decides to return to Long Island with Gatsby, not her husband.&nbsp; Daisy drives Gatsby&rsquo;s car, but she accidentally kills a woman on the side of the road, and then speeds off.&nbsp; It turns out that this woman is Buchanan&rsquo;s girlfriend Myrtle&mdash;she had only run out to see the car because she thought it was Buchanan&rsquo;s.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"center\">Myrtle&rsquo;s husband blames Buchanan for the death, but Buchanan informs him that it was Gatsby&rsquo;s car that killed the woman. The mechanic goes to Gatsby&rsquo;s house, where he shoots Gatsby and then himself.

It is characterized by a white, flaky substance on the scalp. Dandruff is not a serious condition and neither is it contagious. However, people still want it gone so that their hair looks better.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Following are the misleading conceptions about Dandruff :</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Myth 1: Dandruff results from bad hygiene</strong>?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Fact</strong>: while regular shampooing can help keep dandruff under control, this condition does not stem from a lack of hygiene, even the most diligent hair washers can find themselves suffering from it. This is because dandruff is caused by various components, which include a characteristic overproduction of hair oil or an excess of parasitic microorganisms that live normally on our scalps.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Myth 2: Dandruff only occurs on the scalp?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Fact</strong>: it's true that your scalp is the most widely recognised spot to experience dandruff, yet it's by all account not the only possibility. A few individuals additionally observe that areas such as the eyebrows, ears, and around the nose are inclined to flaking too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Myth 3: All flakes in your hair is dandruff?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Fact</strong>: sometimes flakes are only a consequence of dry skin on your scalp. While the difference between dryness and dandruff might be unclear to the common individual, medical experts do make a distinction between the two. If your flakes are relatively small and white, chances are you are dealing with a dry scalp, dandruff flakes tend to be larger and yellowish in colour.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Myth 4: Dandruff is contagious?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Fact</strong>: dandruff is not something that you can catch from someone else. The fungal bacteria that can lead to the appearance of dandruff are present on everybody's scalp, which means that our scalp is naturally predisposed to the condition.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Myth 5: Dandruff can cause hair fall?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Fact</strong>: hair fall is at some point connected with dandruff and an irritated scalp; however, these conditions are not mutually exclusive. Hair fall is not brought about by dandruff, but rather might be prompted by the incessant need to scratch a bothersome scalp. When we scratch our heads, the activity causes breakage in the hair. The root cause of hair fall includes anxiety, diet and the overall health of your scalp.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/dandrufff1476005271457.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"579363ed4c0ab56541be1c26","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"dandruff"},{"text":"chronic hair conditions"},{"text":"bad hygiene"},{"text":"scalp"},{"text":"dryness"},{"text":"fungal bacteria add a tag"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"https://www.lybrate.com/topic/5-dandruff-myths-busted/09e1afc9b671c575034e9f64fde9c188","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T09:28:00.494Z","udate":"2016-10-10T04:43:27.259Z","expirydate":"2016-11-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-10T04:43:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fa0da0e66f216b816f4997","id":"57fa0da0e66f216b816f4995","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out3324.mp3","tagsForSearch":"dandruff,chronic hair conditions,bad hygiene,scalp,dryness,fungal bacteria add a tag","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57fa0e89d0e65a6a84b32fd2","title":"Cholesterol: Good and Bad of It","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e90b17dbb41078bba9f","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Over the last few decades, the word cholesterol has assumed a different connotation. It has come to be known as a silent killer that spells doom for health. However, what we need to realize is that a certain amount of cholesterol is essential for the proper functioning of the body. The liver produces about 85% of the cholesterol that is required by the body normally. The ever changing food habits have introduced a lot of processed foods that are loaded with saturated fats. Along with this, reduced physical activity has led to accumulation of cholesterol in the blood.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The types of cholesterol are based on the density and we have 2 types of density that is Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) and High Density Lipoprotein (HDL). LDL is more dangerous than HDL, called as bad and good cholesterol respectively. In addition, the triglycerides and lipoprotein are also critical indicators of overall cholesterol levels. Depending on a person's age, height and weight, normal levels are derived for each of these four.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because of their density of the cholesterol molecules, as they are circulating in the blood stream, they tend to get sluggish and settle down along the walls of the blood vessels, referred to as plaque. This plaque attracts more and more cholesterol from the blood and the layer gets gradually thicker. This reduces the thickness of the blood vessels and in severe cases even completely blocks blood flow to important organs like the brain and heart, leading to severe conditions like stroke and heart attack respectively.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>However, it is not always that all cholesterol is bad. It is one of the essential things for the proper body functions with the main functions listed below:</strong></p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Each cell in the body requires it to form the cell membrane, the protective layer around the cells</li>\n<li>Synthesis of vitamin D is done with the help of cholesterol, which is very essential for skin health</li>\n<li>It also helps in hormone formation. In addition to steroids, other hormones like testosterone, estrogen, cortisol require cholesterol as a main ingredient</li>\n<li>Formation of neurotransmitters and overall nerve function requires cholesterol. This ensures optimal neurological functioning.</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, as noted above, there are, both good and bad aspects to cholesterol. It is not all that dangerous a thing that it is made out to be. The trick is to maintain a good level of cholesterol so that the body's requirements are met, and at the same time, the harmful effects are kept at bay. Some important parameters to manage, include the percentage of bad cholesterol in the blood and the ratio of triglycerides to HDL in the blood. These are considered fair indicators of heart health and if need be, lifestyle changes and/or medications can be undertaken to manage overall health and reduce risk of heart disease and stroke.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/cholestrol1476005504889.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"579363ed4c0ab56541be1c26","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"cholesterol"},{"text":"liver"},{"text":"processed foods"},{"text":"saturated fats"},{"text":"physical activity"},{"text":"low density lipoprotein"},{"text":"high density lipoprotein"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"https://www.lybrate.com/topic/cholesterol-good-and-bad-of-it/b027e9c1e0e8b948ebb2e126e72ad990","namastheUrl":"","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T09:31:53.438Z","udate":"2016-10-10T04:43:27.259Z","expirydate":"2016-12-20T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-10T04:43:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fa0e89d0e65a6a84b32fd4","id":"57fa0e89d0e65a6a84b32fd2","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","tagsForSearch":"cholesterol,liver,processed foods,saturated fats,physical activity,low density lipoprotein,high density lipoprotein","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Her efforts are hampered by the fact that many of the country&rsquo;s most talented entrepreneurs are retiring and disappearing. The railroad&rsquo;s crisis worsens when the Mexican government nationalizes Taggart&rsquo;s San Sebastian Line. The line had been built to service Francisco d&rsquo;Anconia&rsquo;s copper mills, but the mills turn out to be worthless. Francisco had been a successful industrialist, and Dagny&rsquo;s lover, but has become a worthless playboy. To solve the railroad&rsquo;s financial problems, Dagny&rsquo;s brother Jim uses political influence to pass legislation that destroys Taggart&rsquo;s only competition in Colorado. Dagny must fix the Rio Norte Line immediately and plans to use Rearden Metal, a new alloy created by Hank Rearden. When confronted about the San Sebastian mines, Francisco tells Dagny he is deliberately destroying d&rsquo;Anconia Copper. Later he appears at Rearden&rsquo;s anniversary party and, meeting him for the first time, urges Rearden to reject the freeloaders who live off of him.</p>\n<p>The State Science Institute issues a denunciation of Rearden metal, and Taggart&rsquo;s stock crashes. Dagny decides to start her own company to rebuild the line, and it is a huge success. Dagny and Rearden become lovers. Together they discover a motor in an abandoned factory that runs on static electricity, and they seek the inventor. The government passes new legislation that cripples industry in Colorado. Ellis Wyatt, an oil industrialist, suddenly disappears after setting fire to his wells. Dagny is forced to cut trains, and the situation worsens. Soon, more industrialists disappear. Dagny believes there is a destroyer at work, taking men away when they are most needed. Francisco visits Rearden and asks him why he remains in business under such repressive conditions. When a fire breaks out and they work together to put it out, Francisco understands Rearden&rsquo;s love for his mills.</p>\n<p>Rearden goes on trial for breaking one of the new laws, but refuses to participate in the proceedings, telling the judges they can coerce him by force but he won&rsquo;t help them to convict him. Unwilling to be seen as thugs, they let him go. Economic dictator Wesley Mouch needs Rearden&rsquo;s cooperation for a new set of socialist laws, and Jim needs economic favors that will keep his ailing railroad running after the collapse of Colorado. Jim appeals to Rearden&rsquo;s wife Lillian, who wants to destroy her husband. She tells him Rearden and Dagny are having an affair, and he uses this information in a trade. The new set of laws, Directive 10-289, is irrational and repressive. It includes a ruling that requires all patents to be signed over to the government. Rearden is blackmailed into signing over his metal to protect Dagny&rsquo;s reputation.</p>\n<p>Dagny quits over the new directive and retreats to a mountain lodge. When she learns of a massive accident at the Taggart Tunnel, she returns to her job. She receives a letter from the scientist she had hired to help rebuild the motor, and fears he will be the next target of the destroyer. In an attempt to stop him from disappearing, she follows him in an airplane and crashes in the mountains. When she wakes up, she finds herself in a remote valley where all the retired industrialists are living. They are on strike, calling it a strike of the mind. There, she meets John Galt, who turns out to be both the destroyer and the man who built the motor. She falls in love with him, but she cannot give up her railroad, and she leaves the valley. When she returns to work, she finds that the government has nationalized the railroad industry. Government leaders want her to make a speech reassuring the public about the new laws. She refuses until Lillian comes to blackmail her. On the air, she proudly announces her affair with Rearden and reveals that he has been blackmailed. She warns the country about its repressive government.</p>\n<p>With the economy on the verge of collapse, Francisco destroys the rest of his holdings and disappears. The politicians no longer even pretend to work for the public good. Their vast network of influence peddling creates worse chaos, as crops rot waiting for freight trains that are diverted for personal favors. In an attempt to gain control of Francisco&rsquo;s mills, the government stages a riot at Rearden Steel. But the steelworkers organize and fight back, led by Francisco, who has been working undercover at the mills. Francisco saves Rearden&rsquo;s life, then convinces him to join the strike.</p>\n<p>Just as the head of state prepares to give a speech on the economic situation, John Galt takes over the airwaves and delivers a lengthy address to the country, laying out the terms of the strike he has organized. In desperation, the government seeks Galt to make him their economic dictator. Dagny inadvertently leads them to him, and they take him prisoner. But Galt refuses to help them, even after he is tortured. Finally, Dagny and the strikers rescue him in an armed confrontation with guards. They return to the valley, where Dagny finally joins the strike. Soon, the country&rsquo;s collapse is complete and the strikers prepare to return.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/atlas1476006085560.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"ayn rand"},{"text":"rational capitalism"},{"text":"colorado"},{"text":"fountain head"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/atlasshrugged/summary.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T09:41:32.415Z","udate":"2016-12-17T09:51:13.254Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T09:37:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T09:36:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","publiseherSectionId":"57fa09bad0e65a6a84b32f5e","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fa10ccd0e65a6a84b3301b","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out2662.mp3","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"ayn rand,rational capitalism,colorado,fountain head","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

He&rsquo;s a bright kid who gets along well with his classmates. When he&rsquo;s 9, he meets Annabel Leigh at his father&rsquo;s hotel. He falls in love with her. She dies of typhus after the summer and he&rsquo;s crushed by the death&mdash;perhaps permanently. Her death means he can never have sex with her. Later, he believes it is this fact&mdash;her impossible attainability&mdash;that leads to his twisted character.</p>\n<p>Humbert has a fatal flaw&mdash;he loves charming young girls between ages 9 and 14, who he calls &ldquo;nymphets.&rdquo; Nymphets arouse him and he obsesses with them. He has very little feelings for adult women. He marries, trying to have a normal domestic life, but the marriage fails and he moves to the United States.</p>\n<p>After an Arctic expedition and several visits to mental hospitals, Humbert moves in with a New England woman, Charlotte Haze, and her young daughter, Dolores &ldquo;Lo&rdquo; Haze. Lo is a 12-year-old nymphet. From the moment Humbert lays eyes on her, he feels that he must have her. He chooses to stay with the Haze family as a tenant. Meanwhile, Charlotte has feelings for Humbert, which he can no longer ignore after she goes to drop off Lo at camp and leaves him a letter declaring her love. He can only stay in the house if he tells Charlotte that he feels the same way and marries her. Humbert loves Lo so much that he has no choice&mdash;he must stay and marry Charlotte in order to stay close to Lo.</p>\n<p>Their marriage doesn&rsquo;t last long. Lo, who has nursed a schoolgirl crush on Humbert, remains at camp during their short marriage. The newlyweds&rsquo; bliss is cut short by Charlotte&rsquo;s discovery of Humbert&rsquo;s diary, in which he recorded his stalking notes about Lo. Distraught, Charlotte races out of the house and a car hits her, and she dies. Humbert can barely believe his luck.</p>\n<p>He picks up Lo from camp and takes her to a hotel, which begins their road trip. At the hotel, he has sex with her. He doesn&rsquo;t let her know that her mother is dead until the next day. The girl has no choice but to stick with Humbert. For the next year, Humbert and Lo travel the country, living in hotels and motels. Lo is his prisoner. They eventually settle in Beardsley, a college town, and Lo briefly attends school there. At the school, she takes part in the drama group and meets the author of her school play, Clare Quilty.</p>\n<p>After&nbsp;a particularly nasty fight with Humbert, Lo requests to leave Beardsley. This turns out to be the beginning of the end for Humbert&rsquo;s nymphet love affair. Lo secretly communicates their locations to Quilty, who eventually helps her escape when she is hospitalized for a fever. Humbert vows to take revenge on the mysterious kidnapper. Years later, he finds Quilty after reconnecting with Lo, who is a pregnant, married teenager living in poverty.</p>\n<p>When Lo rejects him after he visits her for the first time since she escaped, he tracks down Quilty and kills him. Humbert is charged with murder and jailed, which the reader knows from the Foreword. In jail, he writes the manuscript, which he requests not to be published until Lo and he are dead. Lo tragically dies while giving birth to her child, which is also described in the Foreword, and Humbert dies in jail.</p>\n<p>The story is told from Humbert&rsquo;s perspective, who is the book&rsquo;s unreliable and subjective narrator. It is divided into two parts and includes a Foreword written by a fictional editor of the manuscript. A note from its author, Vladimir Nabokov, was added after 1956 to the end of the book.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/nabokov_-lolita1476006936056.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","publisherSectionName":"www.hyperink.com","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"lolita"},{"text":"nabakov"},{"text":"controversial novel"},{"text":"incest"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.hyperink.com/Overall-Summary-Forldquololitardquo-By-Vladimir-Nabokov-b352a6","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T09:55:44.779Z","udate":"2016-10-09T09:55:44.779Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T09:55:31.735Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T09:55:19.000Z","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","publiseherSectionId":"57fa1420e66f216b816f4a3e","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fa1420e66f216b816f4a3d","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out7595.mp3","tagsForSearch":"lolita,nabakov,controversial novel,incest","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57fa1470e66f216b816f4a3f","title":"Understanding scrub typhus, the jungle fever that is stalking Himachal Pradesh","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e90b17dbb41078bba9f","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The disease</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Scrub typhus, also known as bush typhus because the mites (Leptotrombidium deliense, commonly known as trombiculid mite) that cause it reside in vegetation predominantly comprising small shrubs, is an infectious disease with symptoms similar to any viral fever. However, it is not caused by a virus, but by a parasite called Orientia tsutsugamushi, which is transmitted by the bite of infected mite larvae in soil containing scrub vegetation. The disease is more common during the wet season when the mites lay eggs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The symptoms</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The disease has an incubation period of 6-21 days, and lasts for 2-3 weeks. At onset there is fever, headache, bodyache, cough and gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients with a mild infection may recover without any other symptoms. However, roughly every second patient develops a visible black scab at the point of the bite, with a swelling of the lymph nodes. In about a third of cases, a delayed onset of rashes occurs 4-6 days into the disease. Severe cases typically include encephalitis and interstitial pneumonia due to vascular injury. The fatality rate is 7%.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sores caused by the mite&rsquo;s bites are usually one of the distinguishing features of the disease, crucial for clinical diagnosis. Similarities in presentation with chikungunya often confounds the diagnosis, doctors say. Like in dengue and chikungunya, the commonest &mdash; and cheaper &mdash; diagnostic tests involve looking for the antibodies to the parasite rather than the parasite itself in the bloodstream. An indirect immunoperoxidase test or a dot immunoassay or tests for detection of IgM and IgG fall under this category. The failsafe test is the expensive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Outbreak in Himachal</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While dengue and chikungunya have remained the focus, scrub typhus has killed some 24 people in Himachal Pradesh, and affected about 855 others so far this year. The Union Health Ministry promised support to the state on Tuesday. In Delhi, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences has reported more than 30 cases. Himachal Pradesh is one of the endemic areas for the disease &mdash; it is also endemic in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Thailand, northern Australia, the Arabian peninsula and Japan. It is an occupational disease frequently found in people who work in the fields and are in the habit of gardening.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Himachal crisis</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Himachal Pradesh, the disease spreads most commonly during grass cutting operations in the orchards, and is alleged to have taken a serious turn this year due to laxity in controlling the mite. The Health Department has reportedly been asking the Horticulture Department to ask its university for advice on measures to eradicate the mite, and to incorporate these pesticides in spraying schedules, but no response has been forthcoming, however, allege officials. State health officials also say that including an advice to wear socks to the fields in the Information, Education and Communication (IEC) campaign would have helped check the disease.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Treatment</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Antibiotics like Doxycycline or Azithromycin are commonly used to treat the disease. Most cases are self-limiting, and hospitalisation is not required. In fact, in endemic areas, treatment is often started without the final confirmatory diagnostic test. Any fluctuation in blood pressure, pulse rate or respiratory rate (hyperventilation) in a patient with undiagnosed fever, rashes, etc. though should immediately be reported to the nearest hospital. The outcome is often complicated by a reliance merely on clinical diagnosis, with doctors tending to prescribe the ineffective betalactam (&szlig;-lactam) antibiotics.

About 5 percent of the nation's 29 million Americans with diabetes have this type.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Doctors said they have long awaited a device that could help patients around the clock. \"I can't wait to get my hands on it because I can think of a lot of our patients who need this,\" said the Cleveland Clinic's Dr. Betul Hatipoglu. \"Now I have a helper who is going to help me to help them.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Type 1 diabetes patients now have to manage their insulin through multiple injections throughout the day or a drug pump that delivers it through a tube. Their own pancreas doesn't make insulin, a hormone needed to turn food into energy. They face increased risks of dangerously high blood-sugar levels, heart disease and many other health problems.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The new MiniMed 670G consists of a drug pump, a sensor that measures blood sugar and a tube that delivers the insulin. The sensor measures sugar levels every 5 minutes, infusing or withholding insulin as needed. Patients still have to manually increase insulin before meals.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Medtronic said the device will cost between $6,000 and $9,000, similar to its other insulin pumps. Older insulin pumps simply deliver a baseline level of insulin, and patients must monitor their sugar levels and give themselves more insulin to keep their blood sugar from getting too high. A big danger is having too much insulin in the body overnight, when blood-sugar levels naturally fall. People can go into comas, suffer seizures and even die.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Food and Drug Administration said it approved the device based on a three-month study of more than 120 patients. The study reported no major adverse events, such as dangerously low blood sugar, showing that the device is safe for those 14 years and up, regulators said in a release. The pump is about the size of a deck of cards and can be worn on a belt or carried in a pocket.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The device \"can provide people with Type 1 diabetes greater freedom to live their lives,\" said Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, director of the FDA's device center. While the device can currently only be marketed for Type 1, doctors said it could eventually be used by those with Type 2 diabetes, where the body gradually loses the ability to produce or use insulin.<br />Many of those patients are overweight or obese and face increased risk of heart attack, stroke and kidney failure. \"Type 2 diabetes is such an overwhelming spectrum of the disease and I think there's a significant slice of that pie that could benefit from the artificial pancreas,\" said Dr. Robert Courgi of Southside Hospital on New York's Long Island.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The agency said it is requiring Ireland-based device manufacturer Medtronic to further study the implant's performance in patients. The company is also studying the device for potential use in children ages 7 to 13. A number of other companies are developing similar products, including Dexcom and Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/pancreas1476007370433.jpeg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baab806a12cf7ee39133b8","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"fda"},{"text":"health and well being"},{"text":"pancreas"},{"text":"type 1 diabetes"},{"text":"heart disease"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/health-and-wellbeing/290916/artificial-pancreas-to-help-diabetes-patients-gets-approved.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T10:02:57.992Z","udate":"2016-10-10T04:42:08.043Z","expirydate":"2016-12-14T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-10T04:42:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fa15d1cf43e76842714beb","id":"57fa15d1cf43e76842714be9","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6615.mp3","tagsForSearch":"fda,health and well being,pancreas,type 1 diabetes,heart disease","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

{"_id":"57fa1899e66f216b816f4a71","title":"Home Remedies to Get Rid of Prickly Heat / Sweat Rash","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e75bec71f6cb1a62d18","content":"<h2 class=\"content16\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">What is Prickly Heat?</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The rising temperatures bring in a number of skin-related ailments that can be quite irksome. One such, fairly common, condition is <strong>prickly heat, </strong><strong>also referred to as heat rash or sweat rash.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Clinically known as miliaria, sweat rashes can appear anywhere on your body</strong>. While it is most commonly seen as an underarm sweat rash, it may also manifest around the groin, feet, back, back of the neck, hands, chest, and abdomen. In some severe cases of prickly heat, a person may also see rashes on their face and neck. This condition affects adults and infants alike.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Common Causes for Prickly Heat</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The most common cause of a heat rash is hot and humid weather that leads to <a class=\"vcontentshlink\" title=\"Interesting Information About Excessive Sweating\" href=\"http://www.medindia.net/patients/patientinfo/hyperhidrosis.htm\" target=\"_blank\">excessive sweating</a> and blocked eccrine sweat glands (major sweat glands in the human body). Once blocked, the sweat from these glands seeps out onto a person&rsquo;s skin and leads to a sweat rash. Other causes include underdeveloped sweat glands - a common cause for this kind of rash in babies - and being overweight.<br /><br />While prickly heat normally resolves on its own, one of the best ways to help relieve its symptoms is to cool your body down, by either staying in a cold room, taking a refreshing shower or applying a salve on the affected area.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Top 7 Home Remedies for Prickly Heat</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Being that a <a class=\"vcontentshlink\" title=\"Top Tips to Beat the Summer Heat\" href=\"http://www.medindia.net/patients/lifestyleandwellness/top-tips-to-beat-the-summer-heat.htm\" target=\"_blank\">summer rash</a> is quite common, there are a number of ways to help treat the symptoms of prickly heat. But while those methods may be easier, they may not be as helpful in relieving the symptoms of the condition quickly. So, to help you out, here are somesummer rash home remedies for effective relief:</p>\n<ul class=\"group-list\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li><strong>Multani Mitti and Rose Water:</strong> Also known as Fuller&rsquo;s Earth, multani mitti has been used as a common home remedy for a number of skin-related ailments. This is because fuller&rsquo;s earth has many properties that not only soothes but also disinfects the skin. Apart from that, it also helps cool down the area and helps unclog pores, relieving the symptoms of prickly heat. Take two to three spoons of multani mitti and add some rose water to it, so as to make a paste. Apply this on the affected area and allow it to dry. Once dried, you can wash it off with some cold water. Using this remedy twice or thrice a day can help reduce the severity if you have a heat rash.</li>\n<li><strong>Sandal Wood Powder and Rose Water:</strong> This mixture is extremely soothing for the skin and is a great sweat rash treatment. Both sandalwood and rose water have soothing properties that help relieve the burning and pricking sensation of prickly heat. Apart from that, the antibacterial properties of sandalwood ward off infection in the area. All you need to do is take a spoon full of sandalwood powder and mix it with some rose water to make a paste. Apply this paste on the affected area and allow it to dry. Once dry, wash off the paste with cold water. Using this remedy once every day for a week can help cure prickly heat naturally.</li>\n<li><strong>Oatmeal:</strong> Another great remedy for prickly heat, oatmeal has very potent anti-inflammatory properties that help reduce the discomfort associated with a sweat rash. Apart from that, it also has soothing properties that reduce the sensation of <a class=\"vcontentshlink\" title=\"Information about Itchy Skin\" href=\"http://www.medindia.net/patients/patientinfo/itchy-skin.htm\" target=\"_blank\">itching</a> and irritation associated with a heat rash. <br /><br />In order to use this remedy, add one cup of finely ground oatmeal to a bathtub of cold water. Stir the water well until it turns milky white in color. Soak in the tub for about 20 to 30 minutes and then pat yourself dry with a soft cloth or towel. Doing this once or twice every day is extremely effective in relieving the symptoms of a heat rash.</li>\n<li><strong>Baking Soda:</strong> A great exfoliating agent, baking soda helps unclog your pores that in turn reduces inflammation, itching and irritation. It can also be used as a dusting powder to help absorb excess sweat and reduce the irritation caused due to a sweat rash. <br /><br />To use this remedy, add a tablespoon of baking soda to one cup of cold water. Now, dip a piece of cloth in the solution and wring out the excess water. Place the cloth on the affected area for about ten minutes for relief. Doing this four to five times a day can bring great relief.</li>\n<li><strong>Cold Compress:</strong> Applying an ice pack or cold compress to the affected area helps provide immediate relief and prevents the sweat rash from spreading to other parts on your body. The cold compress also helps relieve itching, reduces inflammation and lowers sensation on your skin &ndash; reducing that pricking sensation. All you have to do is wrap a few ice cubes in a piece of soft cloth and gently apply it to the area. Alternatively, you could also dip a cloth in some cold water and place it on your skin for immediate relief. Make sure you do not keep the cold cloth or ice in contact with your skin for more than 10 to 15 minutes at a time. Use this remedy twice a day for effective relief.</li>\n<li><strong>Cornstarch: </strong>This remedy works the same way as the baking soda one. Not only does it help unclog the pores and relieve the symptoms of prickly heat, but it also helps calm irritated and inflamed skin, preventing the further spread of prickly heat. To use this remedy, take two spoons of cornstarch and add some water to it, to make a paste. Now apply this paste on the affected area and allow it to dry. Once it is dry, splash some cold water on the dried cornstarch and wash away the pack.</li>\n<li><strong>Potato: </strong>A cooled slice of potato, is also a great remedy for a heat rash. Potato has soothing properties for the skin and helps relieve the inflammation caused due to a heat rash. Cooled potato slices help cool the skin and prevent the further spread of the sweat rash. To use this remedy, take a cooled slice of potato and rub it over the affected area. Doing this two to three times a day can help reduce the symptoms of prickly heat to a great extent.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Heat Rash in Babies</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Babies or infants are especially prone to a heat rash or sweat rash as their sweat glands and ducts are not fully developed, making it extremely easy for them to get clogged &ndash; thereby leading to prickly heat. While you can use the same home remedies to get rid of a sweat rash in babies, it is always best to consult your pediatrician as to the best course of action. <br /><br /><strong>Here&rsquo;s how you can prevent the onset of prickly heat:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"group-list\">\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wear loose and comfortable clothing that does not rub against your skin.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Avoid using cream or oil based creams and lotions as they can clog your pores and lead to prickly heat.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">As far as possible, try to avoid exposure to heat and humidity.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Take a bath every day and, if possible, twice a day.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are prone to the condition, make sure you use a medicated powder to prevent its onset.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Drink plenty of water and stay hydrated.</li>\n</ul>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/sandalwoord-rosewater-pack-for-heat-eash1476008080629.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","publisherSectionName":"medindia.net","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"prickly heat"},{"text":"sweat rash"},{"text":"heat rash"},{"text":"excessive sweating"},{"text":"summer rash"},{"text":"itching"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.medindia.net/homeremedies/prickly-heat.asp","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T10:14:49.078Z","udate":"2016-10-10T04:42:08.043Z","expirydate":"2016-12-13T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-10T04:42:00.000Z","publiseherSectionId":"57fa1899e66f216b816f4a74","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fa1899e66f216b816f4a73","id":"57fa1899e66f216b816f4a71","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out8169.mp3","tagsForSearch":"prickly heat,sweat rash,heat rash,excessive sweating,summer rash,itching","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

The urine can then be eliminated from the body when bladder is full. The bladder contracts to empty its contents outside through the urethra (the connection between the bladder and outside of the body). Urethra length traverses the length of the penis in males, thus it is longer than the urethra in females.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<h3>What causes bladder infections?</h3>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Similar to other fluids in the body, urine is normally sterile.

{"_id":"57fa2061cf43e76842714cd2","title":"WHY WE READ (AND WRITE) SHORT STORIES","subtitle":"LORRIE MOORE ON THE FORM \"SECOND TO NONE IN POWER AND EFFICIENCY\"","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8f88ebfe246bd8ebd873","content":"<p><em>The following is adapted from&nbsp;the introduction to</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hmhco.com/shop/books/100-Years-of-The-Best-American-Short-Stories/9780547485850\" target=\"_blank\">100 Years of the Best American Short Stories</a>.</p>\n<p>A story is a noise in the night. You may be lying there quietly resting in the international house of literature and hear something in the walls, the click and burst of heat through pipes, a difficult settling of eaves, ice sliding off the roof, the scurry of animals, the squawk of a floorboard, someone coming up the stairs.</p>\n<p>This is life itself, surprising and not entirely invited. And yet we come to short stories seeking it. Or at least some vivid representation of it: a dark corner that is either turned and gone around or fixed with a light in order to discover what is lurking there. In a civilized society there arrives in a person&rsquo;s day a pause long enough to allow for the reading of it&mdash;the corner, the pause, the day, the society: the exquisite verbal bonsai of a moment, of another&rsquo;s life and consciousness, presented with concision and purpose&mdash;from a certain angle, in a certain voice, fashioned from a frame of mind that is both familiar and strange, recognizable and startling as a pinch.</p>\n<p>It is a lovely shock of mercy and democracy to find that we need to spend time in the company of people whose troubles we might ordinarily avoid. Ring Lardner&rsquo;s clueless barber. (&ldquo;&lsquo;Shut up,&rsquo; he explained,&rdquo; as Lardner wrote elsewhere.) Lauren Groff &rsquo;s bewitched eccentrics. Edward Jones&rsquo;s lovelorn convicts. This is why storytelling exists in the first place. To inform us from and of Georgia O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s &ldquo;faraway nearby.&rdquo; It keeps us posted on the colorful swarming muck beneath a log. It both crashes in and lifts us out of the many gated communities of the mind. It animates (rather than answers) a question or two you may have about, say, Jesus. Finish a story and then you can return to healthy living, getting moderate exercise, appreciating unspoiled nature (good luck to you), and swooning at the wondrous universe as viewed in a clear night sky (rather than that narratively familiar dark and stormy one).</p>\n<p>Make it interesting and it will be true: this is what story writers live by. In the way of Flaubert, storytelling is investigative and conjectural: we tell stories to find out what we believe. In the way of Joan Didion, we tell them &ldquo;in order to live.&rdquo; In the way of Scheherazade, we tell them in order not to die. Dreams, it turns out, are physiologically necessary for life. Presumably waking dreams are just as essential. Neurological experiments have shown that animals deprived of dreams die faster than they would by physical starvation. Science has also shown that stories help the mind make order and sense of random events. Furthermore, in a new study reported in the journal <em>Science,</em>subjects who read Alice Munro stories&mdash;specifically, the collection <em>Too Much Happiness</em>&mdash;demonstrated sharper social and psychological insight than those who did not.</p>\n<p>Hey, we knew that.</p>\n<p>But now there is empirical proof for others. In the words of Lorenz Hart, &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re awake, the things you think / Come from the dreams you dream / Thought has wings and lots of things / are seldom what they seem&rdquo; (&ldquo;Where or When&rdquo;). He also wrote, &ldquo;The clothes you&rsquo;re wearing are the clothes you wore,&rdquo; a condition familiar to any writer at her desk. There&rsquo;s always room for a little Broadway.</p>\n<p>Short stories are about trouble in mind. A bit of the blues. Songs and cries that reveal the range and ways of human character. The secret ordinary and the ordinary secret. The little disturbances of man, to borrow Grace Paley&rsquo;s phrase, though a story may also be having a conversation with many larger disturbances lurking off-page. Still, the focus on the foregrounded action will be sharp and distilled as moonshine and maybe a little tense and witty, like an excellent dinner party. Writers go there to record hearts, minds, manners, and lives, their own and others. Even at a dinner party we all want to see rich and poor, life and death, the past and the present bumping up against each other, moral accomplishment jostling moral failure. Readers desire not to escape but to see and hear and consider. To be surprised and challenged and partially affirmed. In other words, to have an experience.</p>\n<p>It is difficult for a short story to create a completely new world or a social milieu in its entirety or present an entirely unfamiliar one or one unknown to the author&mdash;so little time and space&mdash;so stories are often leaning on a world that is already there, one that has already entered the writer&rsquo;s mind and can be assembled metonymically in a quick sketch and referred to without having to be completely created from scratch. To some degree the setting is already understood and shared with the reader, although the writer is giving it his own twist or opinion or observations or voice. To someone unfamiliar with such a thing, for instance, the zombie apocalypse might have trouble fitting into this genre, despite the short story&rsquo;s great range of subjects, lengths, voices, and techniques. The short story&rsquo;s hallmark is compression&mdash;even if the story sometimes extends to near-novella length. The short story needs to get to the point or the question of the point or the question of its several points and then flip things upside down. It makes skepticism into an art form. It has a deeper but narrower mission than longer narratives, one that requires drilling down rather than lighting out. Like poetry, it takes care with every line. Like a play, it moves in a deliberate fashion, scene by scene. Although a story may want to be pungent and real and sizzling, still there should be as little fat as possible. In its abilities to stretch, move through time, present unexpected twists and shapes, the short story is as limber as Lycra but equally unforgiving. (It is interested in the human heart, of course, an artificial version of which was first made in the 1970s from the fabric of a woman&rsquo;s girdle&mdash;a fun fact and a metaphor for inventiveness, which will become clearer if one walks around the block and thinks about it a little.)</p>\n<p>The abundant, crazily disparate imagery that comes to mind when considering and generalizing about the genre demonstrates what story writers all know: the short story is pretty much theory-proof. One pronounces upon it with spluttering difficulty. An energetic effort may send one into a teeming theme park of argument, mixed metaphor, tendentious assertion. It has been said that the short story is the only genre of literature that has remained pre-modern. Here I suppose the speaker is thinking of the campfire tale, and the telling of something in a single sitting: in this paradigm a story retains some of its primitive delights. The size remains organic to the occasion.</p>\n<p>But the short story has also been declared the very first modernist literature (with which I am more inclined to agree). As a record of rebellious human consciousness, of interiority and intersecting intents, it is second to none in power and efficiency.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/reading-a-story1476010074071.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","publisherSectionName":"lithub.com","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"shortstories writing"},{"text":"shortstories reading"},{"text":"lorrie moore"},{"text":"best american short stories"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://lithub.com/why-we-read-and-write-short-stories/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T10:48:01.355Z","udate":"2016-12-17T10:56:53.279Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T10:47:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T10:47:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","publiseherSectionId":"57f895694a8d835943bd32a1","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fa2061cf43e76842714cd4","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out8086.mp3","audioImageUrl":"","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"tagsForSearch":"shortstories writing,shortstories reading,lorrie moore,best american short stories","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57fa2081d0e65a6a84b33133","title":"Triggers for Acne","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e90b17dbb41078bba9f","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Acne is an inflammatory skin disorder which is prevalent in both males and females. When the sebaceous glands present on skin produce excessive sebum, the hair follicles present on skin get clogged leading to the formation of acne.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Acne can be triggered by a number of factors. Here are some of the common triggers for acne:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Genetics</strong>: If one or both parents have acne, their children have high chances of suffering from it as well. Genes influence the sensitivity of your skin towards hormones such as androgens and progesterone that trigger acne. They also influence the production of anti inflammatory chemicals in the skin and skin's response to bacteria.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Stress</strong>: The severity of acne can be correlated to the levels of stress a person is facing. While scientists are yet to figure the exact relationship between stress and acne; it is known that the cells that produce sebum or oil also act as stress receptors. Studies suggest that when a person is under stress, these cells produce excessive sebum that clogs pores on the skin leading to pimples.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Hormones</strong>: Hormones play an important role in skin health especially when it comes to women. Androgens or the male hormones present in both men and women, trigger acne by over stimulating the oil glands. Women may also see an increase in pimples during menstruation. This is due to the fluctuating levels of progesterone that stimulate the production of sebum.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Medication</strong>: Acne is one of the side effects to a few types of medication such as corticosteroids and anticonvulsants. However, this is not seen very often. On the other hand, drugs that contain hormones such as androgenic steroids almost always cause an acne breakout. Treatment for acne depends on the severity of the condition and its persistence. Mild cases can be easily treated with over the counter medication, but if your acne is severe and not affected by these medications, it best to consult a dermatologist.</li>\n</ol>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/acnee1476010104902.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"579363ed4c0ab56541be1c26","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"genetics"},{"text":"stress"},{"text":"hormones"},{"text":"medication"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"https://www.lybrate.com/topic/triggers-for-acne/40e9c50550a4b935ebc4f650d67fac0f","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T10:48:33.371Z","udate":"2016-10-13T10:11:03.236Z","expirydate":"2016-12-07T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-10T04:37:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fa2081d0e65a6a84b33135","id":"57fa2081d0e65a6a84b33133","publishedBy":"57dd1bc3fb61356b41a1bb60","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out2024.mp3","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"tagsForSearch":"genetics,stress,hormones,medication","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

{"_id":"57fa224eb38e1d5d6a0c3fc3","title":"Trikatu, the herb that balances","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e75bec71f6cb1a62d18","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Long before allopathy became the science it is now, doctors and medical practitioners were using herbs to heal the body. As evidence grows that certain herbs really do have a good effect on the body, and as people tire of chemical cocktails, it&rsquo;s good to step back and consider herbs instead.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In my occasional column on herbs that heal, here&rsquo;s a look at what trikatu, a very common ayurvedic prescription, can do.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Trikatu</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Properties: Made from three pungent (katu) herbs, trikatu comprises black pepper (kali mirch), ginger (adhrakh) and long pepper (pippali), which, when consumed together, cut through accumulated mucous and open up the channels of nutrition. This helps balance the &lsquo;agni&rsquo; of the body.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Rx</em>: The usual prescription is one teaspoon of trikatu mixed with one teaspoon of organic honey, once a day.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Healing effects</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. It helps digest and expectorate mucous, making it good for disorders that are caused by excessive mucous, such as asthma, and all problems connected to the head and neck, such as sinusitis, throat problems, cough and cold.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. It balances the metabolism, and is useful for both, poor digestion and excessive appetite.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. It helps reduce water retention during menopause.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. Since it removes toxins, it helps in cases of low sexual vigour and poor sperm quality.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">5. Since it is a detoxifier, it eliminates excessive cholesterol from the system.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">6. It is excellent for diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes caused by an imbalanced diet, with the addition of triphala. In this case, mix trikatu and honey in warm water and drink it three times a day. Also mix triphala chorine with warm water and drink it twice a day, on an empty stomach in the morning, and at night at bedtime.</p>\n<section class=\"story_top_news\">\n<div class=\"news_photo\"><img src=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_800x600/HT/p2/2016/09/23/Pictures/_4f15e946-8193-11e6-a0d9-e435f3f63e15.tif\" /></div>\n<h2>Mixing triphala with trikatu helps in type 2 diabetes (Shutterstock)</h2>\n</section>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Warning</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>*</strong>Lactating and expecting mothers must avoid trikatu unless they are supervised by an ayurvedic doctor.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>*</strong>If your kidneys are affected by diabetes and you are on dialysis, take trikatu only under the supervision of an ayurvedic doctor.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>*</strong>Likewise, if you have ulcers and complicated digestive disorders, avoid trikatu unless its consumption is medically supervised.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/trikatu1476010566299.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf27934a4ac2d218b21ca","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"trikatu"},{"text":"ayurveda"},{"text":"healing"},{"text":"diabetes"},{"text":"detoxify"},{"text":"herbal"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.hindustantimes.com/brunch/trikatu-the-herb-that-balances/story-nRSZpWs1Tz98p5mA1NlH8L.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T10:56:14.545Z","udate":"2017-01-12T07:33:52.773Z","expirydate":"2016-12-26T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-10T04:37:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fa224eb38e1d5d6a0c3fc5","id":"57fa224eb38e1d5d6a0c3fc3","publishedBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"trikatu,ayurveda,healing,diabetes,detoxify,herbal","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out9085.mp3"}
{"_id":"57fa2268cf43e76842714d01","title":"HOW TO BE A WRITER: 10 TIPS","subtitle":"JOY, SUFFERING, READING, AND LOTS AND LOTS OF WRITING","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8f88ebfe246bd8ebd873","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1) Write.&nbsp;</strong>There is no substitute. Write what you most passionately want to write, not blogs, posts, tweets or all the disposable bubblewrap in which modern life is cushioned. But start small: write a good sentence, then a good paragraph, and don&rsquo;t be dreaming about writing the great American novel or what you&rsquo;ll wear at the awards ceremony because that&rsquo;s not what writing&rsquo;s about or how you get there from here. The road is made entirely out of words. Write a lot. Maybe at the outset you&rsquo;ll be like a toddler&mdash;the terrible twos are partly about being frustrated because you&rsquo;re smarter than your motor skills or your mouth, you want to color the picture, ask for the toy, and you&rsquo;re bumbling, incoherent and no one gets it, but it&rsquo;s not only time that gets the kid onward to more sophistication and skill, it&rsquo;s effort and practice. Write bad stuff because the road to good writing is made out of words and not all of them are well-arranged words.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2) Remember that writing is not typing.&nbsp;</strong>Thinking, researching, contemplating, outlining, composing in your head and in sketches, maybe some typing, with revisions as you go, and then more revisions, deletions, emendations, additions, reflections, setting aside and returning afresh, because a good writer is always a good editor of his or her own work. Typing is this little transaction in the middle of two vast thoughtful processes. There is such thing as too much revision&mdash;I&rsquo;ve seen things that were amazing in the 17th&nbsp;version get flattened out in the 23rd&mdash;but nothing is born perfect. Well, some things almost are, but they&rsquo;re freaks. And you might get those magical perfect passages if you write a lot, including all the stuff that isn&rsquo;t magic that has to be cut, rethought, revised, fact-checked, and cleaned up.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3) Read. And don&rsquo;t read.</strong> Read good writing, and don&rsquo;t live in the present. Live in the deep past, with the language of the Koran or the Mabinogion or Mother Goose or Dickens or Dickinson or Baldwin or whatever speaks to you deeply. Literature is not high school and it&rsquo;s not actually necessary to know what everyone around you is wearing, in terms of style, and being influenced by people who are being published in this very moment is going to make you look just like them, which is probably not a good long-term&nbsp;goal for being yourself or making a meaningful contribution. At any point in history there is a great tide of writers of similar tone, they wash in, they wash out, the strange starfish stay behind, and the conches. Check out the bestseller list for April <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishers_Weekly_list_of_bestselling_novels_in_the_United_States_in_the_1930s#1937\" target=\"_blank\">1935</a>&nbsp;or August 1978 if you don&rsquo;t believe me. Originality is partly a matter of having your own influences: read evolutionary biology textbooks or the Old Testament, find your metaphors where no one&rsquo;s looking, don&rsquo;t belong. Or belong to the other world that is not quite this one, the world from which you send back your messages. Imagine Herman Melville in workshop in 1849 being told by all his peers that he needed to cut all those informative digressions and really his big whale book was kind of dull and why did it take him so long to get to the point. And actually it was a quiet failure at the time. So was pretty much everything Thoreau published, and Emily Dickinson published only a handful of poems in her lifetime but wrote thousands.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4) Listen. Don&rsquo;t listen.</strong> Feedback is great, from your editor, your agent, your readers, your friends, your classmates, but there are times when you know exactly what you&rsquo;re doing and why and obeying them means being out of tune with yourself. Listen to your own feedback and remember that you move forward through mistakes and stumbles and flawed but aspiring work, not perfect pirouettes performed in the small space in which you initially stood. Listen to what makes your hair stand on end, your heart melt, and your eyes go wide, what stops you in your tracks and makes you want to live, wherever it comes from, and hope that your writing can do all those things for other people. Write for other people, but don&rsquo;t listen to them too much.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5) Find a vocation.</strong> Talent is overrated, and it is usually conflated with nice style. Passion, vocation, vision, and dedication are rarer, and they will get you through the rough spots in your style when your style won&rsquo;t give you a reason to get up in the morning and stare at the manuscript for the hundredth day in a row or even give you a compelling subject to write about. If you&rsquo;re not passionate about writing and about the world and the things in it you&rsquo;re writing about, then why are you writing? It starts with passion even before it starts with words. You want to read people who are wise, deep, wild, kind, committed, insightful, attentive; you want to be those people. I am all for style, but only in service of vision.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>6) Time.</strong> It takes time. This means that you need to find that time. Don&rsquo;t be too social. Live below your means and keep the means modest (people with trust funds and other cushions: I&rsquo;m not talking to you, though money makes many, many things easy, and often, vocation and passion harder). You probably have to do something else for a living at the outset or all along, but don&rsquo;t develop expensive habits or consuming hobbies. I knew a waitress once who thought fate was keeping her from her painting but taste was: if she&rsquo;d given up always being the person who turned going out for a burrito into ordering the expensive wine at the bistro she would&rsquo;ve had one more free day a week for art.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>7) Facts.</strong> Always get them right. The wrong information about a bumblebee in a poem is annoying enough, but inaccuracy in nonfiction is a cardinal sin. No one will trust you if you get your facts wrong, and if you&rsquo;re writing about living or recently alive people or politics you absolutely must not misrepresent. (Ask yourself this: do I like it when people lie about me?) No matter what you&rsquo;re writing about, you have an obligation to get it right, for the people you&rsquo;re writing about, for the readers, and for the record. It&rsquo;s why I always tell students that it&rsquo;s a slippery slope from the things your stepfather didn&rsquo;t actually do to the weapons of mass destruction Iraq didn&rsquo;t actually have. If you want to write about a stepfather who did things your stepfather didn&rsquo;t, or repeat conversations you don&rsquo;t actually remember with any detail, at least label your product accurately. Fiction operates under different rules but it often has facts in it too, and your credibility rests on their accuracy. (If you want to make up facts, like that Emily Bronte was nine feet tall and had wings but everyone in that Victorian era was too proper to mention it, remember to get the details about her cobbler and the kind of hat in fashion at the time right, and maybe put a little cameo at her throat seven and a half feet above the earth.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>8) Joy.</strong> Writing is facing your deepest fears and all your failures, including how hard it is to write a lot of the time and how much you loathe what you&rsquo;ve just written and that you&rsquo;re the person who just committed those flawed sentences (many a writer, and God, I know I&rsquo;m one, has worried about dying before the really crappy version is revised so that posterity will never know how awful it was). When it totally sucks, pause, look out the window (there should always be a window) and say, I&rsquo;m doing exactly what I want to be doing. I am hanging out with the English language (or the Spanish or the Korean). I get to use the word turquoise or melting or supernova right now if I want. I&rsquo;m with Shelley, who says that poets are the unacknowledged&nbsp;legislators of the universe, and I am not fracking or selling useless things to lonely seniors or otherwise abusing my humanity. Find pleasure and joy. Maybe even make lists of joys for emergencies. When all else fails, put on the gospel song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsEZI7DTHLs\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Steal My Joy&rdquo;</a>&mdash;refrain is &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t gonna let nobody steal my joy.&rdquo; Nobody, not even yourself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But it&rsquo;s not about the joy, it&rsquo;s about the work, and there has to be some kind of joy in the work, some kind from among the many kinds, including the joy of hard truths told honestly. Carpenters don&rsquo;t say, I&rsquo;m just not feeling it today, or I don&rsquo;t give a damn about this staircase and whether people fall through it; how you feel is something that you cannot take too seriously on your way to doing something, and doing something is a means of not being stuck in how you feel. That is, there&rsquo;s a kind of introspection that&rsquo;s wallowing and being stuck, and there&rsquo;s a kind that gets beyond that into something more interesting and then maybe takes you out into the world or into the place where deepest interior and cosmological phenomena are at last talking to each other. I&rsquo;ve written stuff amidst hideous suffering, and it was a way not to be so stuck in the hideous suffering, though it was hard, but also, hard is not impossible, and I didn&rsquo;t sign up with the expectation that it would be easy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>9) What we call success is very nice and comes with useful byproducts, but success is not love,</strong> or at least it is at best the result of love of the work and not of you, so don&rsquo;t confuse the two. Cultivating love for others and maybe receiving some for yourself is another job and an important one. The process of making art is the process of becoming a person with agency, with independent thought, a producer of meaning rather than a consumer of meanings that may be at odds with your soul, your destiny, your humanity, so there&rsquo;s another kind of success in becoming conscious that matters and that is up to you and nobody else and within your reach.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>10) It&rsquo;s all really up to you,</strong> but you already knew that and knew everything else you need to know somewhere underneath the noise and the bustle and the anxiety and the outside instructions, including these ones.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">- REBECCA SOLNIT</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/teaching1476010592694.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","publisherSectionName":"","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"rebecca solnit"},{"text":"how to write?"},{"text":"style"},{"text":"structure"},{"text":"editing"},{"text":"10 tips"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://lithub.com/how-to-be-a-writer-10-tips-from-rebecca-solnit/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T10:56:40.223Z","udate":"2016-10-09T10:56:40.223Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T10:54:26.607Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T10:54:13.000Z","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","publiseherSectionId":"57f895694a8d835943bd32a1","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fa2268cf43e76842714d03","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out7181.mp3","tagsForSearch":"rebecca solnit,how to write?,style,structure,editing,10 tips","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

And, when I say locales, in the modern urban context, flamboyant or not quite fancy cafes and eateries dominate your imagination. One of the most brazen consequences of such hangouts is the increased consumption of junk and oily food. In fact, for many of us, the idea of good times is inextricably linked to consumption of good food which inevitably reads as junk food. Junk food craving is something we are all culpable of. While most of us know about the health implications that junk food entails, we usually choose to elide over them for the sake of our hunger pangs. However, there are certain ailments that accrue from the intake of junk foods and which, if neglected, can lead to certain grave consequences.</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Causes Diabetes-&nbsp;</strong>Diabetes is one of the most prevalent diseases in the contemporary times. Affecting people from all age groups, diabetes has assumed almost an epidemic stature. Junk food consumption is one of the most blaring causes of diabetes. These kind of foods are not only deficient in fibers but also the heavy oil content of the junk food misbalances your metabolism and spurs off other medical conditions like obesity.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Increases the chances of digestive malfunctions-&nbsp;</strong>Since the junk foods are usually fried in oil and are brimming with fats, they are most suited to disrupt the normalcy in the process of digestion. As they get deposited on the linings of the stomach walls, the production of acid gets increased, leading to diseases like GERD and IBS.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Causes kidney Diseases-&nbsp;</strong>Junk food addition is a scientifically proven vicious cycle. Most junk foods contain finely processed salts which stimulate enzymes, which turn disrupt the salt balance in your body. This results in a situation of hypertension in the body and affects the kidney functioning to a large extent.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Increases the risk of heart diseases-&nbsp;</strong>Junk foods are extremely rich in Trans fats which spike up the cholesterol levels in your blood. This excess potentially raises the risk of inflammation in the blood vessels and emerge as chronic threats to the normal functioning of the heart.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Leads to depression-&nbsp;</strong>Statistically, the largest proportion of junk food consumers is between the ages of 12 to 35. Consequently, this age group is also susceptible to the most rancid hormonal imbalances. Junk food, injects an abnormal quantity of salts in the body, thus affecting the hormonal levels. This makes them vulnerable to depressions and mood swings.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Memory and Learning Problems-&nbsp;</strong>Junk food rich in sugar and fat suppress the activity of a Brain Peptide called BDNF (Brain- Derived Neurotrophic Factor ) which ultimately lead to inflammation in the hippocampus area of the brain which is responsible for learning and memory formation.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Risk of Dementia-&nbsp;</strong>Unlike Pancreas insulin is also produced in the brain which carries the signals between the nerve cells and forming memories ,but this process is hampered due to increase the increase level of insulin in the body and brain stops responding to hormones and become resistant thus increasing.</li>\n</ol>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/junk_food1476011401444.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"579363ed4c0ab56541be1c26","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"oily food"},{"text":"health implications"},{"text":"diabetes"},{"text":"digestive malfunctions"},{"text":"kidney diseases"},{"text":"heart diseases"},{"text":"depression"},{"text":"memory"},{"text":"learning problems"},{"text":"dementia"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"https://www.lybrate.com/topic/here-s-why-a-junk-food-diet-could-also-be-setting-you-up-for-serious-health-problems-f353/f81f1f0b932a9a393c01ffefa77299c3","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T11:10:09.310Z","udate":"2016-10-10T04:37:34.586Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-10T04:37:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fa259138939368e0c04aac","id":"57fa259138939368e0c04aaa","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out1903.mp3","tagsForSearch":"oily food,health implications,diabetes,digestive malfunctions,kidney diseases,heart diseases,depression,memory,learning problems,dementia","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Of course, we&rsquo;re still playing catch-up; many of these books have already been published in South Africa, Nigeria, or the UK, or in their original language. But that just means that old classics are becoming suddenly available alongside emerging new voices. So if you&rsquo;re looking for something to read, and you want it to have the word &ldquo;African&rdquo; attached to it, here are my top 25 suggestions for the first six months of the new year.&nbsp;All dates are for U.S. publications. Chain bookstores won&rsquo;t carry most of these, so you might have to do something as laborious and difficult as click a link&ndash;or ask your local bookstore to place a special order&ndash;but the one thing you can&rsquo;t do, any longer, is complain you have nothing to read.

And though there is no shortage of secular writers writing about religion, Aboulela is the rare reverse, a novelist whose deep Muslim faith animates her explorations of Islamic identity in the secular world. Each chapter of <em>The Kindness of Enemies</em> begins in present-day Scotland&mdash;where a history professor must grapple with how to respond to a student of hers, she has been told, who has become &ldquo;radicalized&rdquo;&mdash;before moving back into the 1850s, where we get the story of her student&rsquo;s ancestor, the Imam Shamil, whose 30-year campaign against the expanding Russian empire stands as one of the most <em>successful </em>military jihads in history. But as with all of Aboulela&rsquo;s novels, her focus is essentially intimate, the story of small lives and loves; against the backdrop of war and empire, Aboulela&rsquo;s eye is on human stories about lost faith and lost children, some of which are sometimes found again.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-30050 size-medium\" src=\"http://d3rde5ck80dcsn.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/51rStkmd-kL-200x300.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" srcset=\"http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/51rStkmd-kL-200x300.jpg 200w, http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/51rStkmd-kL-100x150.jpg 100w, http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/51rStkmd-kL.jpg 333w\" alt=\"Tahar Ben Jelloun, The Happy Marriage\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /><strong><strong>Available now</strong>:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.mhpbooks.com/books/the-happy-marriage/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Happy Marriage</em> by Tahar Ben Jelloun</a> (Translated by Andr&eacute; Naffis-Sahely &middot; Melville House)</p>\n<p>Tahar Ben Jelloun is the sort of writer who gets mentioned every year as a possible contender for the Nobel, though he&rsquo;s probably too good to ever get it. France claims him and he lives in Paris, but the focus of his novels has always been Morocco. From a very nice <a href=\"http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/893/the-art-of-fiction-no-159-tahar-ben-jelloun\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Paris Review</em> interview</a>, Jelloun describes why he writes in French:</p>\n<p>At the lyc&eacute;e we studied the Arab classics; I became aware of the richness and subtlety of Arabic when I began to do translations. To me it was another good reason not to tinker with it. Also, as it is a sacred language, given by God in the shape of the Koran, it is intimidating&mdash;one feels very small in front of this language. The other day Adonis, a great Lebanese poet, told me that the Arabic language has not yet had a writer stronger than itself, capable of subduing it. One speaks of English as the language of Shakespeare, of Italian as that of Dante, but we don&rsquo;t say Arabic is the language of al-Ghazali&mdash;it is always the language of the Koran. It is inhibitive; one would feel almost guilty manipulating it&hellip; Arabic is a sacred language, and Arab authors are in awe of it; they can&rsquo;t use violence against it.</p>\n<p>In <em>The Happy Marriage</em>, a painter tells the story how his marriage collapsed as he is recovering from a stroke that he blames his wife for provoking; when his wife reads his account of these events, she gives her own side of the story.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31597\" src=\"http://d3rde5ck80dcsn.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/the-book-of-memory.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px\" srcset=\"http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/the-book-of-memory.jpg 201w, http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/the-book-of-memory-100x150.jpg 100w\" alt=\"the book of memory petina gappah\" width=\"201\" height=\"300\" /><strong>February 2:</strong> <a href=\"us.macmillan.com:thebookofmemory:petinagappah\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Book of Memory</em> by Petina Gappah</a> (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)</p>\n<p>Petina Gappah&rsquo;s <em>The Book of Memory </em>is the only Nabokovian meditation on living in memory&mdash;from the perspective of an albino inmate of a Zimbabwean women&rsquo;s prison&mdash;that you need to read this year. The long-awaited first novel by the author of <em>An</em> <em>Elegy for Easterly</em>, this book is a marvel, fluttering from high to low with a deceptive ease, and slipping in more words per page of untranslated Shona than any book this readable has any right to contain. But though <em>An Elegy for Easterly </em>was widely praised for its dissection of contemporary Zimbabwean politics and society, and despite all of its wonderfully granular detail and quotidian attentiveness to the life of a maximum security death row inmate in Zimbabwe&mdash;no doubt informed by Gappah&rsquo;s years as a lawyer&mdash;<em>The Book of Memory</em> is ultimately much less interested in the particularities of Zimbabwe in the Mugabe era, or in the law, or even in race than in the story of how we float on the currents of time on the brightly colored wings of memory.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31598\" src=\"http://d3rde5ck80dcsn.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rachels-blue.jpg\" alt=\"rachel's blue zakes mda\" width=\"197\" height=\"300\" /><strong>February 15:</strong> <a href=\"http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/R/bo23194391.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rachel&rsquo;s Blue</em> by Zakes Mda</a> (University of Chicago Press)</p>\n<p>I always feel bad that I haven&rsquo;t read more of Zakes Mda&rsquo;s work, but every time I read one of his books, it feels like he&rsquo;s published another novel or two. His dozens of plays and novels were written in the decades of South Africa&rsquo;s long, slow, painful transition from Apartheid but range across its even longer and more painful history, from early colonialism to the present, excavating histories and memory that never made it to the official records of truth and reconciliation. An astute critic once described him as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/29/books/review/sometimes-there-is-a-void-memoirs-of-an-outsider-by-zakes-mda-book-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">living in a different country than J.M.

His first novel, <em>The Hairdresser of Harare,</em>was a black comedy of political manners, in the Zimbabwe of ZANU-PF and hyperinflation&mdash;and along with a sly treatment of sexuality that&rsquo;s worth the price of admission alone&mdash;it put Huchu&rsquo;s name on a lot of lists of writers to watch. In <em>The Maestro, The Magistrate &amp; The Mathematician</em>, he has moved outward to the community of expatriate Zimbabweans living in Edinburgh but waiting for the time to be right to return, triumphantly, home. As he put it in an interview, &ldquo;most of the novels I read about diasporas are about folks on a sort of upward trajectory and I kind of wanted to go in the opposite direction.&rdquo; His cast is mostly very highly educated people, living and working in low-wage jobs while dreaming of home. He splits the story between three interlinked-but-detached perspectives&mdash;between the maestro, the magistrate, and the mathematician&mdash;but out of it produces a single &ldquo;a book of illusions;&rdquo; as he puts it, &ldquo;though the narrators of all three novellas are reliable, they are still being lied to.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31608\" src=\"http://d3rde5ck80dcsn.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/and-after-many-days1.jpg\" alt=\"and after many days jowhor ile\" width=\"205\" height=\"300\" /><strong>February 16:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/250685/and-after-many-days-by-jowhor-ile/9781101903148/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>And After Many Days</em> by Jowhor Ile</a> (Penguin Random House)</p>\n<p>Everybody is very excited about this debut novel from a writer living in Port Harcourt, Nigeria&mdash;Taiye Selasi, Uzodinma Iweala, A.

But that&rsquo;s getting it the wrong way round. The book isn&rsquo;t about how the world network defines our new reality: it displays Coovadia&rsquo;s lingering investment in mapping a single nation. He does this across ten different plots divided into sections headed by references variously to their period or setting (&ldquo;School Time&rdquo;, &ldquo;Soviet Embassy&rdquo;), to a significant object (&ldquo;The Pass&rdquo;, &ldquo;Vuvuzela&rdquo;), or to a central event (&ldquo;Truth and Reconciliation&rdquo;). These sections, each of which appears only once, are arranged in nonchronological order and cover timeframes from 1970, when the metric system was introduced in South Africa, to 1999, which saw the close of the postapartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission, to 2010, the year of the World Cup.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31779\" src=\"http://d3rde5ck80dcsn.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/the-reactive-cover.png\" alt=\"The Reactive by Masande Ntshanga\" width=\"222\" height=\"300\" /><strong>April 12: </strong><a href=\"http://twodollarradio.com/products/the-reactive\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Reactive</em> by Masande Ntshanga</a> (Two Dollar Radio Press)</p>\n<p>This is a novel about AIDS and drugs: set in the period in which the South African government refused to acknowledge the AIDS crisis, it&rsquo;s the story of a group of young men who sold anti-retroviral medication to those who couldn&rsquo;t access the medication.

The black Americans she follows are not overly virtuous victims. Sin comes in all forms, from selling people to abandoning children. I think I needed to read a book like this to remember what is possible. I think I needed to remember what happens when you pair a gifted literary mind to an epic task.

The retirement home called me when they found her scrawling on the walls of her apartment, twice in her own excrement, once in the blood of her old dog, Peace.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that she&rsquo;s scaring people,&rdquo; the Cherry Grove Homes director said in his thin, nasally voice. I could picture him on the other end, a white button-down, a red tie, perpetually smiling. &ldquo;And we aren&rsquo;t a nursing home, you know; we&rsquo;re an independent living facility. I&rsquo;m afraid we have to ask her to leave.&rdquo; I flew to Alabama immediately, boxed up all of my mother&rsquo;s possessions, and flew her away to live with me in California.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She had not spoken more than one sentence since seeing me, standing helpless and frightened on the welcome mat of her apartment. Now, walking around my two-bedroom house in Menlo Park, she began whispering to herself in Twi.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Why did you kill Peace?&rdquo; I asked. The retirement home director told me they had found the dog in the backyard with his neck slit, his front paws folded and touching as though he were praying.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She turned sharply toward me. &ldquo;Sacrifice,&rdquo; she said, before continuing to pace the house. Her English was deteriorating and, though my comprehension was still good, I hadn&rsquo;t spoken Twi since childhood. I crushed an Ambien into the tea that I made for her, and when she began to nod off, I tucked her into the guest bed, went into my own room, and cried until morning.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When I was eight I asked Jesus to come into my heart and be my Lord and Savior. My mother walked me down to the altar herself, and she held my hand as our pastor whispered his prayer into my ear, inviting me to repeat after him. I remember how warm his breath felt against my ear, this part of my body that I so rarely noticed. I remember thinking how that warmth would travel a line through the ear and to my heart, that it would burn away the floor of it so that Jesus might find space there. This was how I explained it to my mother that night when we were back in our one-bedroom apartment in Huntsville, Alabama.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>She made kissing faces at herself after she had finished the lipstick, and I would imitate that face for hours after she left.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Jesus <em>is</em> a fire,&rdquo; she said. She was getting ready for her job as the night custodian at the local hospital, and I was watching her apply makeup in the mirror. She made kissing faces at herself after she had finished the lipstick, and I would imitate that face for hours after she left. &ldquo;He consumes us.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I nodded, not to humor her, but because I believed, because I was alone with my mother in our bathroom, and I was alone again that night after she left me kissing my own reflection in the mirror, and yet I had never felt so full.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She was already in the kitchen when I finally got out of bed. The kettle was on, and the smell of <em>koko</em>, one of the many Ghanaian dishes I had never learned to cook for myself, filled the air.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t use the stove, Mama,&rdquo; I said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Have you been eating?&rdquo; she asked.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The top of my pajamas had pulled up and the soft flesh of my stomach was exposed. I pulled a chunk and wiggled it at her. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it look like I&rsquo;m eating?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She swatted me. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nasty, Gifty.&rdquo; And just when I had decided that there was nothing wrong with her, that the whole thing had been a bad dream, she stared into the blue and orange glow of the stove&rsquo;s fire and said, &ldquo;Revelations was not the end. I have been called.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I pulled her away to sit at the table. I poured a bowl of <em>koko</em> for her, but within seconds, her finger was in it, and she was using the thick porridge to write on my oak table.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Stop it,&rdquo; I said, snatching her hand away, but then her left hand flew up and began where the right had left off.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The doorbell rang, and I shouted, &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; afraid to leave my mother alone for so much as a second. I had made an appointment for her with a geriatric psychiatrist for later in the month, but from what the retirement home&rsquo;s therapist had told me, there wasn&rsquo;t much that could be done. She needed constant care because a demented mind could turn. Moments of lucidity could bring about feelings of shame and hopelessness worse than living in the dementia. Because of this, I had arranged for a home health nurse to come watch her during the day so that I could go teach. The nurse was a round Bajan woman with a stern voice. I had already given her instructions and a tour of the house before my mother arrived, and so I let the two of them get to know each other while I showered. They seemed well acquainted by the time I left.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I taught English at Stanford. The Modernist poets mostly, though Gerard Manley Hopkins was my area of expertise. This quarter I was teaching a senior seminar of his work to students who were likely only taking the course to fulfill their British Literature 1750-1900 requirement. I didn&rsquo;t mind. I had once been like them, skeptical of anything that wasn&rsquo;t flashy and contemporary, wary of anything that smacked of nature writing, but I had been wooed by Hopkins in college, seduced by the tension of his work, a tension that I had felt my whole life: flesh versus God.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My students strolled in, some hungover, others stinking of cigarette smoke. They sat at our large, round table and stared at me expectantly, but that day I simply stared back.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What I wanted to ask was, what had any of us ever sacrificed? If it came to it, would we lay our Isaacs down?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Melissa, the class know-it-all, whipped her hand into the air. &ldquo;Professor Asare, are you all right?&rdquo; she asked. She had colored her hair over the weekend. Blond and whiter blond highlights ran through the thick section that always seemed to cover her left eye.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I shook my head, tried to shake myself out of my stupor. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m fine. Where did we leave off?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;We were talking about how Hopkins destroyed a bunch of his undergraduate poetry,&rdquo; Melissa said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; I said, but then I stopped. The rest of my words dissolved in my mouth as I looked at their young, confused faces. What I wanted to say was that Hopkins had written the ultimate poem in that destruction. The burning of his earlier works was his rebirth as a man of God, a symbol of his devotion to the Jesuit priesthood. What I wanted to ask was, what had any of us ever sacrificed? If it came to it, would we lay our Isaacs down?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The class stared at me, and as I stared back the room began to get hazy at the edges, as though I were looking at an old photograph of my class instead of my class itself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not feeling well,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You can take the rest of the day off.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some lingered, asked if I needed anything, but most bounded away, trying to mask their happiness in sympathetic frowns. When they were all gone, I slumped down in my seat and rested my head against my class notes. I couldn&rsquo;t sleep. All I could do was think.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What I kept coming back to was fire. By high school I had abandoned God. When my mother asked if I wanted to go to church with her I would make up an excuse. Homework or babysitting were usually enough, but sometimes I needed something more elaborate.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going on a school field trip this weekend,&rdquo; I said to her one Friday morning, and because I was not the kind of child who lied, and because she was not the kind of parent who checked up on me, I ended up driving down to Gulf Shores with my friend Ellie.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We met up with a couple of boys Ellie knew from her church, an Episcopalian church my mother had deemed &ldquo;too stuffy&rdquo; the day she&rsquo;d met Ellie and grilled her about her beliefs. The boys were named Steven and Tony. Tony was Ellie&rsquo;s boyfriend, and Steven was obviously some kind of offering for me. He was tall, with the perfectly straight teeth of upper-middle class, white America. That night, while we were on the beach, Steven and I held back while Tony and Ellie walked ahead of us.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What are you into?&rdquo; Steven asked. He was a private school kid, the kind who had a hard time relating to people without money. His question sounded like a line from an anthropological study titled &ldquo;Black, Poor, Immigrant.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Books, I guess,&rdquo; I answered. I had just gotten my acceptance letter from Princeton two weeks before, and I had hidden it in the underwear drawer of my dresser. Whenever my mother asked if it had come yet, I would say no, and she would pat my back and say, &ldquo;You are going. Believe it and receive it, Gifty. God is good.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t want to give God any credit for how hard I had worked.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s cool. I think I&rsquo;ll probably major in computer science or something,&rdquo; Steven said. We stopped next to a shell that had washed ashore, and Steven bent down to grab it. He fingered the shallow ridges, put it against his ear, and then against mine.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I hear your mom&rsquo;s kind of crazy,&rdquo; he said. I was listening to the ocean inside the shell, ignoring the ocean at my feet.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s just strict,&rdquo; I said, and he put the shell down. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s religious.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Steven nodded. That night, he and Tony started a bonfire in the backyard of Tony&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; beach house. There weren&rsquo;t many people our age around, but we&rsquo;d found a few and invited them over, drinking the booze that was stashed in various spots around the house, but before long, everyone had gone, and Tony and Ellie made a big show of going back into the house together.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The fire was dying down. I didn&rsquo;t know how to build a fire, how to keep one going if I wanted it to keep going. Steven was an Eagle Scout, but he simply looked on as the fire went, little by little, into the night.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He leaned in closer to me. It was inevitable, really. It was what we had come for. And as I parted my lips and then, later, my legs, watching the last clouds of smoke slip upward, I kept hearing my mother&rsquo;s voice say, &ldquo;Jesus is a fire.&rdquo;</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At the house, my mother was napping. The nurse gave me a rundown of all that had happened that day, from what she had eaten to what she had done and said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;She pray for me,&rdquo; the nurse said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I put my hand to my mouth. &ldquo;Oh, God, I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo; It was a Californian reaction. I had once been chastised by a woman for offering her daughter a balloon at a friend&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s birthday party. The woman had touched my hand and whispered, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to avoid giving Helen things that are red because we&rsquo;ve found that the color makes her anxious.&rdquo; I&rsquo;d nodded. I&rsquo;d even apologized.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, the nurse shook her head at me. &ldquo;Why you sorry? It was nice. What it hurt to have somebody pray for you?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It wasn&rsquo;t really a question, but I kept thinking about it as though it were. What would it hurt to be prayed for, to pray? Knees were the only thing I could think of, remembering how my mother had made me kneel down on them, every night, once for an entire day.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t pray for a whole day,&rdquo; I had argued. &ldquo;Your mind will wander.&rdquo; Still, she knelt, and so I did too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Restless after ten minutes, I&rsquo;d asked, &ldquo;What are you even saying?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She looked over at me. &ldquo;First, I say thank you,&rdquo; she said, her Twi fast and thick. &ldquo;I say thank you for my daughter, that she has good health and strong teeth. I say thank you that you have watched over us so that we can be here in America, together. I say thank you for my job. Thank you for my life. Thank you that I am not alone.&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I had long ago learned not to make mention, even indirectly, of my father, a man who had been trying to find his way to meet us in America for most of my childhood.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You are alone,&rdquo; I said. It was a whisper, more air than words really, and I regretted it almost immediately. I had long ago learned not to make mention, even indirectly, of my father, a man who had been trying to find his way to meet us in America for most of my childhood. And, upon discovering that there was no way, had married again, started over.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My mother bowed her head and said, &ldquo;No, Gifty. I am not alone.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After the nurse had gone, I started dinner. Jollof rice was one of the few dishes I had mastered. I always used brown rice instead of white, which seemed to offend my mother, and so tonight, for her, I&rsquo;d stopped at an Asian market and picked up the kind she approved of. I heated oil to fry plantains, and as the first slices hit the pan, the sound and smell of sizzling palm oil brought my mother out of the room and down the stairs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As we sat down to eat, I watched her. She kept her hair short and neat. She bathed twice a day. She was still my mother.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What will the Future Testament be about?&rdquo; I asked timidly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;It is just stories,&rdquo; she said in English. &ldquo;Things God tell me about.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Can I read it?&rdquo; I asked. She looked at me, surprised, but then she smiled and nodded. For years, my mother had been baffled by my love of reading. The only book she owned was her Bible, and I was never convinced that she actually read it. I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I would ever see the Future Testament, if it was written in pen on paper and not just porridge or blood, things that could wash away.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After she finished eating, my mother insisted on washing the dishes. I let her, standing a few paces away to make sure she didn&rsquo;t hurt herself. When she finished, I took her to the bedroom and tucked her in, something she had never done for me, the act being too American for her to understand, even on those nights when I had asked for it, explaining to her how Ellie&rsquo;s parents read her books before sleep. On those nights my mother just tapped my Bible, ragged and worn on my nightstand. &ldquo;You know how to read.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I went back downstairs and started to rewash the dishes. There were little bits of hardened food fused to each plate, and I scrubbed so hard the palms of my hands started to hurt. Since retrieving my mother, I had been feeling an overwhelming guilt for having left her in a retirement home at all, even though she had insisted that after leaving Ghana she would never move again. California, she said, though not separated from Alabama by an ocean, was simply too far.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After I had finished the dishes, I went to the couch to read from some of Hopkins&rsquo;s letters and soon found the one I was looking for, one he had written to his mother in the spring of 1877 to tell her about &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Grandeur&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Starlight Night.&rdquo; He wrote:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>I think I must send you two sonnets I wrote in a freak the other day; they will<br />make a little gift. They are not so very queer, but have a few metrical effects,<br />mostly after Milton&hellip;. These rhythms are not commonly understood but do<br />what nothing else can in their contexts.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My junior year of college I had taken a class on Wordsworth and Hopkins where we had worried the lines of this letter for an entire day&rsquo;s lecture.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My classmates had all given me strange looks, and I felt as though I could read in those looks an indictment. The Alabama mute, a Bible thumper, a Jesus freak.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so obviously gay,&rdquo; a girl named Anne had said. She had cascading red curls that formed a curtain over her face. She would shake the red curtain from time to time to reveal the most piercing green eyes I had ever seen.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What makes it obvious?&rdquo; our professor asked.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;&lsquo;Queer?&rsquo;&rdquo; Anne said. &ldquo;&lsquo;Not commonly understood?&rsquo; I mean, I know it&rsquo;s not the same as it is today, but it&rsquo;s just so euphemistic. He wants to come out to his mother, who we know he&rsquo;s super close to, but he&rsquo;s so repressed that all he can talk about is his work, how he&rsquo;s experimenting with rhythm. And why is he experimenting with rhythm? Because he can&rsquo;t experiment with the things that he really wants to. With love. He accepts a love of language and of God as a substitute for a real-life love.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;A love of God is a real-life love,&rdquo; I said. I don&rsquo;t know why I said it. I was so shy that I never spoke in class. When my papers came back to me, the As, written in urgent red, would always be accompanied by a plea for me to contribute to discussion. My classmates all gave me strange looks, and I felt as though I could read in those looks an indictment. The Alabama mute, a Bible thumper, a Jesus freak.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I spent the rest of that week locked in my dorm room with Hopkins&rsquo;s poetry. I didn&rsquo;t know if I believed what I had said in class, but when I read Hopkins I felt so strongly that he believed it. Here was a delight in language that I would never be able to feel, except through him. Each sibilant &ldquo;s,&rdquo; each river-rounded &ldquo;r,&rdquo; announced itself as a jubilation. Hopkins had found a way to rejoice in God when I no longer could. His God came from a world my mother would have deemed too stuffy, but reading his poetry helped me understand what I had felt as a child, that warmth that traveled the ear and arrived at the heart.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I skipped the next lecture and the one after that. The day before the third class, Anne knocked on my door.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I wanted to say that I&rsquo;m sorry if I offended you.&rdquo; She wore a long, thin black dress that floated around her ankles. She ran her fingers through her hair, and for a moment I saw her face.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t offend me. Maybe I offended you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that&hellip; I still think you&rsquo;re wrong.&rdquo; She was inside my room before I could register her movement. She leaned against my bed. &ldquo;I mean, he wrote that letter to his mother because he wanted to tell her something.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;That he had written two new poems.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She shook her head. &ldquo;God isn&rsquo;t enough, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;He is for some people,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;He is for my mother.&rdquo; I must have whispered this last part because Anne asked me to repeat myself, and I said it again, louder, more confidently, like I believed it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Anne moved off the bed, the dress trailing behind her. She came so close to me that I felt I was breathing in her breath. &ldquo;What about you?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Could you stand to live with nothing but a bunch of books? Could you stand not being touched?&rdquo;</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The next morning, I was up before my mother. I had fallen asleep on the couch, the book of letters resting on my stomach. I got up and brushed my teeth. I made pancakes and coffee and waited for my mother to come down.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When she did, I fixed her a plate and watched her rub the sleep out of her eyes. She smiled at me. &ldquo;You look nice today, Gifty.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I looked down and laughed. She used to notice if my skirt was unironed. I was still wearing yesterday&rsquo;s dress.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of the house, Mama. Would you like that? Would you like to go out today?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She stared suspiciously at the pancakes before taking a bite. She nodded.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We went to Bedwell Bayfront Park. It was a nice day, with a gentle wind to keep us cool while we walked. Soon, my mother started to slow down, and I knew she was tired even though she wouldn&rsquo;t say it when I asked. We sat on the first bench we saw.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I pulled out a bag of grapes and handed some to her, and she started to eat them. A bird landed a few paces in front of us and my mother threw a grape to it. The bird poked at the grape with its beak, but didn&rsquo;t eat. Instead, it flew away against the wind.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My mother shrugged. She had never particularly liked animals, but when she moved into Cherry Grove, she&rsquo;d said she wanted a dog. I helped her pick one out, a Chow/Westie mix, an ugly, small dog that could live comfortably in her small apartment. When I&rsquo;d asked her why she wanted to name it Peace, she&rsquo;d said it was because she wanted to have peace in her home. I wondered now if some small seed of dementia had set in, even then. If she had gotten peace only to disrupt it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I started fishing through my bag. It had occurred to me the night before that instead of trying to stop my mother from writing, I should encourage her to do it constructively. I found a notepad and pen and handed them to her. &ldquo;Mama,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Would you like to write something today?&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I had chosen Oxford because it made the most sense. I could walk the grounds Hopkins had walked, visit the places he had loved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She took the paper and pen from me and looked ahead of her. In the distance the Bay stretched and wound, wrapped itself around boggy land. She started to write slowly, so slowly, and I had to fight the urge to look over her shoulder and read.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She used to write me letters in graduate school. I had chosen Oxford because it made the most sense. I could walk the grounds Hopkins had walked, visit the places he had loved. But, it was the furthest away I had ever been from my mother, and I missed her more than I could admit to her. I spent so much of my time at Oxford thinking about how my mother had done such an impossible thing, moving continents with a young child in tow. She had never complained. She had learned to live far away from home, and so I tried to do the same.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Her letters to me were always short and filled with questions. &ldquo;Have you been eating? Have you found a church? Have you met anyone?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You and your mother have such a strange relationship,&rdquo; Anne would say to me often. We were living with four other people in a little blue house on High Street because it was all we could afford. She was finishing up her MPhil when I started applying to schools, and as much as I had wanted to be at Oxford for Hopkins, I knew I wanted to be there for her, too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not strange.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You talk all the time, but she doesn&rsquo;t know anything about you,&rdquo; Anne said. She had cut her hair into a chin-length bob that gave her a very severe look. The haircut made her sound mean even when she wasn&rsquo;t trying to be.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I couldn&rsquo;t explain our closeness to Anne. How I had spent every single day for eighteen years with no one but my mother, how she was so firmly inside me that I couldn&rsquo;t shake her out even if I wanted to. How I didn&rsquo;t want to. Anne thought that because I no longer believed in God, I must have no longer believed in my mother. When I told her about the time we&rsquo;d spent all day praying, Anne had called it abuse. She had two parents and a brother, all doctors. She felt her desire to study English was some kind of subversive act, even though she would end up just like them, a doctor, but different.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In my letters to my mother I would tell her all about what I was studying. I would include whole paragraphs from the papers I was writing, and sometimes, I would send her Hopkins poems.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;It is good for you to study a man of God. I like the poem about the fish,&rdquo; she would write back, and I would want to correct her, tell her that a kingfisher was a bird, but I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t make a difference.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You never talk about personal stuff. Does she even know you live with me?&rdquo; Anne asked, and I ignored her. &ldquo;You know Hopkins kept secrets, and it killed him,&rdquo; she said, directing her sharp gaze toward me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;She knows me, Anne,&rdquo; I&rsquo;d said, setting my book down. &ldquo;And Hopkins would have died either way. Everyone does.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Above the Bay, a bird flew by, its wings elegantly spread as it called out to us or to something else. My mother was nearing the bottom of the notepad. She stopped writing and looked up at me. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go home now, Gifty,&rdquo; she said. I helped her stand, and we slowly made our way back to where I had parked the car. When I got her into the passenger seat, she was still tightly clutching the notepad. She lowered it to her lap, and I finally let my eyes roam the page. I couldn&rsquo;t make out most of the Twi words, but part of the way down the gibberish turned clear, &ldquo;<em>the world&hellip;lit on fire.</em>&rdquo;</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When I first started teaching at Stanford I was thirty-five and single. Colleagues of mine would invite me out to dinner parties and birthday drinks. I took more trips to Napa than I could keep track of. A gorgeous dreadlocked sociology professor named Raymond had pursued me, hopelessly, for four months. I&rsquo;d slept with him one night in the third month, crying the entire time. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What am I doing wrong?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I had phoned my mother while I watched his car drive away for what ended up being the last time. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something wrong with me,&rdquo; I said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I could hear her shuffling around her garden on the other end of the line. She had just moved into Cherry Grove Homes after suffering a small stroke. &ldquo;You miss that woman,&rdquo; my mother said softly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Anne?&rdquo; I asked, and my whole body ached at the mention of her name. So ubiquitous in America that a trip to Starbucks or the post office or a walk around a park could leave me knock-kneed and collapsing, gasping for breath. Anne, loosen the kite strings. Anne, your drink is ready. Anne. Anne. Anne?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We had broken up only a year before, but I could count the number of times my mother and I had talked about her on one hand.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I wondered what else of hers didn&rsquo;t belong to me, what parts of me she would never see.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You are sad, but it will pass,&rdquo; my mother said in Twi. &ldquo;The first few years are very hard, but then time softens the pain.&rdquo; She paused and I could hear the sound of water hitting earth, the dull thud of a dropped hose. &ldquo;Your father would be seventy years old now. I would have been with him for forty years.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I stayed on the line, but I didn&rsquo;t speak. By that point, my father took up almost no space in my mind, but I realized then that my mother had been able to carry something of him with her. Her private world, where she counted the years with him, was it enough for her? I wondered what else of hers didn&rsquo;t belong to me, what parts of me she would never see.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My mother seemed better the rest of that week. The nurse said she enjoyed writing in the notepad during the day and had filled almost half of it. She didn&rsquo;t talk about the Future Testament as much anymore, content, it seemed, to write it instead.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I spent more and more of my time reading Hopkins. I told myself it was because I wanted to be fresh for my class, but really it was because my mother&rsquo;s presence had sparked something in me and Hopkins had always been a way for me to understand her. I used to have a hard time justifying to others why I wanted to study him at all. Wasn&rsquo;t I better suited to African literature, to works by women, anything else, really? In classrooms at Oxford, I had often felt like the lone delegate from some tiny country, hopelessly aware of the fact that I was the only person who looked like me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When I finished graduate school and started teaching, I realized that my scholarship came from kinship. Scholars don&rsquo;t call their obsessions love, but what else could they be? I loved Hopkins. I spent hours thinking about him, about what he would have been thinking when he wrote this or that line, started this or that stanza.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Every time I put my mother to bed that week, I quelled a little bit of my worry. Her doctor&rsquo;s appointment was finally coming up, and I hoped for good news or, at the very least, suggestions. I planned to take the notepad to the doctor, ask if he knew what to make of any of it, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure he would. I was the one who had been trained to find meaning in words, yet, for now, all I could see when I read my mother&rsquo;s script was a confused and sick old woman. I took up my spot on the couch and opened another book of Hopkins&rsquo;s letters.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before he died, Hopkins had been very ill. Unlike my mother, his illness had shown itself on his body. He wrote to his friends and family about sores and fevers, horrible diarrhea. Some scholars said he was depressed, others that he was bipolar. I had never come around to trying to diagnose him. It didn&rsquo;t much matter what he was. It didn&rsquo;t change what his poems meant to me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I fell asleep with his book on the tips of my fingers again, but soon woke up to the shrill beeping of an alarm. I raced upstairs, and at first, I couldn&rsquo;t see her. On the desk, smoke rose from the notepad. It roamed the room so that I had to cover my mouth to move in. I lifted a blanket from off the bed and started to beat out the small fire, save what I could of the notepad. When I had gotten it all, I finally found my mother kneeling on the ground.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Did you fall?&rdquo; I asked. I was practically screaming the words as I tried to lift her up, but she was too heavy for me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;<em>Awurade gye me. Awurade gye me. Awurade gye me.</em>&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She kept chanting it. <em>Lord take me. Lord take me. Lord take me.</em> She told me once that her own grandmother had said this phrase every time she stood up from the ground, the effort of getting all of her limbs to work in unison being so great that it required divine intervention. But, hearing my mother say it now, I sensed a greater urgency. It was a plea, a prayer.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I started to cry. I hooked my arms under her armpits and tried again to lift, but I couldn&rsquo;t, and so I crumpled down on the floor beside her and held her in my arms as though she were my child.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She stopped chanting and, suddenly, it was like she noticed me there. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, Gifty. The floor doesn&rsquo;t deserve your tears,&rdquo; she said in Twi.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t die,&rdquo; I said to her now. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all alone here. You&rsquo;re it for me, Mama. You&rsquo;re it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Her breathing was shallow. I could feel her back press into me as her lungs worked to fill. In then out. In then out.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;We are never alone,&rdquo; she said, and I started crying even harder. My forty-first birthday was in two months. I had written three books, countless papers. I was the smart, respectable woman my mother had raised me to be, and yet she still had the power to reduce me to my smallest self, to turn me into the confused and frightened child who had gripped her hand as we stepped off the plane from one country, into the next. &ldquo;God is in everything,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He is in everything.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She stopped speaking and finally gathered her breath into a deep and even rhythm, and I clutched her so tightly my knuckles started to hurt. I couldn&rsquo;t tell her that God was little reassurance to me. I couldn&rsquo;t argue with her, not now. For as long as I could remember my mother had been the crazy one, the zealot. So, tonight, she was a disciple. Tonight, we weren&rsquo;t alone. Tomorrow the sun would come up. The birds would start chirping. And what else was there to do but wait for it to all flame out, like shining from shook foil?</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/thomasbaker_TOP1476011953303.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","publisherSectionName":"","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"yaa gyasi"},{"text":"inscape"},{"text":"african story"},{"text":"short story"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"https://www.guernicamag.com/fiction/inscape/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T11:19:22.280Z","udate":"2016-12-17T11:10:55.119Z","expirydate":"2017-10-09T11:19:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T11:17:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","publiseherSectionId":"57f895694a8d835943bd32a1","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fa27ba2040d36ae07b73d4","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out2097.mp3","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"yaa gyasi,inscape,african story,short story","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

{"_id":"57fa2e4dd0e65a6a84b3321d","title":"Pedalling towards a healthy you: How cycling can keep you fit","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e59ebfe246bd8ebd86e","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On a daily basis, cycling is a great form of aerobic exercise that will keep you healthy and fit. For instance, cycling has the capability to reduce the danger of serious medical conditions, from heart disease to high blood pressure, and from obesity to the most widespread form of diabetes. An educated guess has brought into notice that new cyclists &mdash; even those who take the initiative of cycling a short distance &mdash; can increase longevity, as the exercise results in the reduction of heart disease by 20-25 per cent.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cycling can be also part of a weight loss programme, since it burns considerably more calories than any other exercise in the shortest of time span. We&rsquo;re talking 300 calories in just 1 hour. At the gym, that would mean a medium workout for 40-60 minutes. In fact, a 20-minute bike ride to-and-from work, five days a week, has the potential of burning an equivalent of approximately 6kg of fat in a year, according to a study (Your Commute Could Help You Lose Weight, by Rachel Bachman). Cycling also meets the latest suggested target on exercise &mdash; every individual should incorporate mild-medium physical activity, which might leave one a little out of breath, for close to 30 minutes, five times a week.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Heading out with your bicycle can also have quite a positive effect on how you&nbsp;feel as well. Moderate exercise has been found to reduce major levels of depression and anxiety. It does play a vital role in improving mood swings and raising self-esteem in an individual as well. In women, it has been seen to relieve symptoms of premenstrual syndrome.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For the elderly, there can be indirect benefits, like reducing physical damage by falling and hurting yourself, which can be seriously disabling. To build one&rsquo;s leg strength and coordination, cycling is the best way to improve it. This is more important than it seems, because leg strength improves mobility by allowing people to get out of chairs more easily, while improved coordination helps older people avoid falls and the injuries associated with them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are no real age barriers to cycling, and people of almost any fitness level can go ahead and cycle, be it slowly and gently or vigorously &mdash; it all depends on the need and the stamina. Anyone with a heart disease or other conditions affecting their activity ideally needs to consult a physician first before he/she indulges into taking up a fitness programme. Those of all body shapes and all but the most extreme body weights can ride a bike.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But how much you ride depends on you and the type of fitness you have. It has a lot to do with your present lifestyle too. A gradual time of 10-15 minutes of slowly increasing the time span every two weeks to a maximum length of an hour is an ideal way to begin. In a matter of few days or weeks, aerobic form will have enhanced and you will be able to ride for longer distances without feeling anything more than being slightly puffed out.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whether it be indoor or outdoor, cycling in particular has become very popular with people, irrespective of age. With pollution being one of the biggest environmental hazards, and taking up more caution about health and fitness since cycling has become a great way to save on fuel and turn yourself into a much fitter person.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, once you do know of all the merits cycling does have, one tends to wonder whether indoor cycling is the best option or is going outdoors more beneficial. There are many factors you need to take into account before you make up your mind since both are great ways to incorporate fitness into one&rsquo;s life, for instance:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">* The weather plays a major role. No sane person would suggest that you go out cycling during rain and thunder storms or even when there is too much sun outside. For days like those, one should stick to cycling indoors on a stationary bike.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">* The time of the day you choose to train is important, and how much time you can devote to the exercise. If you have a lot of time to spare in the mornings, then cycling outdoors will be a superb option.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">* How much of an investment can you make for your fitness. A stationary bike is more expensive as compared to an ordinary cycle for beginners. You can graduate to expensive options later once you do have a stronger stamina and probably a desire to indulge into a better machine.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">* Cycling outdoors depends upon the space you have for such activity, whether you have a good cycling track or whether you are comfortable cycling in the midst of busy traffic. Indoors would be a better option if you get jittery with the Indian traffic scenario.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All these factors do depend on your personal choices and how easily you can adapt to the new fitness regime you wish to follow. However, it is essential you do not start in full pomp and glory and gradually dampen your spirits to become healthier.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/cylcing_759_thinkstockphotos-1224240421476013636272.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baaa06250c0156ce7311e9","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"pedalling"},{"text":"healthy"},{"text":"fit"},{"text":"weight loss"},{"text":"exercise"},{"text":"aerobic exercise"},{"text":"depression"},{"text":"cycling"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/fitness/how-cycling-can-keep-you-healthy-and-fit-2869771/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-09T11:47:25.455Z","udate":"2017-01-31T06:45:19.058Z","expirydate":"2017-07-01T06:45:31.480Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-10T04:37:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fa2e4dd0e65a6a84b3321f","id":"57fa2e4dd0e65a6a84b3321d","publishedBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"pedalling,healthy,fit,weight loss,exercise,aerobic exercise,depression,cycling","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null}
{"_id":"57fa2f76b38e1d5d6a0c4101","title":"Five simple ways to keep weight in check this festive season","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e59ebfe246bd8ebd86e","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With the festive season approaching, keeping a tab on your weight can be a little difficult. A few precautions can be taken to avoid gaining excessive weight, says an expert.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kajal Bhatia, Consultant Nutritionist at RAW Pressery, a cold pressed juice brand, suggests how:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">* Binge-eating at odd timings is a holiday delight but going overboard is very unhealthy and very easy. Skipping meals to balance out festive eating is also a very bad idea, as it only makes one ravenous later.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To avoid consuming a lot of calories, eat a filling, low-calorie snack or dish before leaving for a celebration. Protein, especially, will keep you feeling full, ensuring you only eat festival treats in small amounts.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also try factoring in a few days of light eating prior to the festive season, in addition to consuming alkaline foods including spinach, broccoli and banana.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">* The best way to control what you consume is to assume the role of the chef. Chefs have to do a lot of tasting and all that time spent in the kitchen does take the edge off hunger. Cooking, or at least deciding what is to be cooked and how, will allow you absolute control over the amount of calories you consume.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Choose the menu wisely, offer guests a range of healthy snacks. Grilling instead of frying, and steaming vegetables to retain nutrients are handy ways to reduce fat intake. Using a low-calorie spray oil is also a great way to roast food in a healthier manner.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">* A fridge stocked with treats after celebrations are over, is not exactly your best bet. If you are the host, make sure to only order or cook as much as needed, carefully drawing up a menu and quantity list.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">* Liquids are an important component of our diets, and binge consumption sessions are no different. A lot of times, our bodies mistake thirst for hunger, which leads to overeating. Craving snacks repeatedly can be a sign of dehydration. A good diet hack is to drink a glass full of water and wait for 10 minutes and then reconsider whether you want to give in to those cravings or not.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Drinking other liquids is also a good solution to hunger pangs, especially having fresh home-made or cold pressed juice blends are perfect and delicious alternatives. This should not be an excuse to have &lsquo;juice drinks&rsquo; (which are loaded with sugar and chemicals) or aerated drinks.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Alcohol is another high-calorie liquid that should be consumed in moderation. Try beginning the night with a refreshing mocktail, and alternate each drink with water or juice.

{"_id":"57fa38a8cf43e76842714e9b","title":"​Contraceptive pills may make women prone to depression","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e2e34a4ac2d218b1a46","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hormonal contraception, including birth control pills or implants, may increase a woman's odds of depression and antidepressant medication use, according to a large study of Danish women.<br /><br />Based on data about prescription drug use for more than 1 million women, researchers found that those who started using hormonal contraception were significantly more likely to subsequently get a first-time prescription for antidepressant medication, compared to women not on hormonal contraception.<br /><br />For adolescent girls, starting on hormonal contraception was tied to an even greater increased risk of antidepressant use. Depending on the type of hormonal contraception, there may have also been a link to risk of being diagnosed with depression.<br /><br />\"Such a comprehensive study on this issue hasn&rsquo;t been made before,\" said senior author Dr. Ojvind Lidegaard, of the University of Copenhagen.<br /><br />Previous studies have tried to clarify connections between contraceptive hormones and depression, Lidegaard and his colleagues write in JAMA Psychiatry, but these produced mixed results.<br /><br />The authors point out that the lifetime prevalence of depression is about double among women compared to men. That difference doesn't emerge until after puberty, though. Two female sex hormones - estrogen and progesterone - are thought to be factors in that increased risk once the reproductive years begin.<br /><br />Lidegaard and his colleagues used data from the ongoing Danish Sex Hormone Register Study, which includes all women living in Denmark. The new piece of research includes women who were ages 15 to 34 years from 2000 through 2013.<br /><br />Any women with a diagnosis of depression that occurred prior to 2000 were excluded from the analysis, as were women with any other major psychiatric diagnosis.<br /><br />The included women were followed for around seven years each. About 55 percent used hormonal contraception during the study period. During that time, 133,178 women were first prescribed antidepressant medications and 23,077 were first diagnosed with depression.<br /><br />Compared to women who didn't use hormonal contraception, those who used birth control pills were 23 percent more likely to be prescribed an antidepressant medication for the first time during the study period.<br /><br />Those using birth control pills that only contained the hormone progestin were 34 percent more likely to be prescribed antidepressant medications. For women using a birth control ring, the increased risk was 60 percent and it was doubled among those using a birth control patch.<br /><br />These risks were also slightly higher among adolescents, the researchers found.<br /><br />Compared to girls 15 to 19 years not using hormonal contraception, the researchers found an 80 percent increased risk of being prescribed antidepressant medication for the first time among girls using birth control pills.<br /><br />The risk was about 120 percent higher among those using progestin-only birth control pills.<br /><br />While the overall risk of being diagnosed with depression was generally the same or lower regardless of the type of birth control women used, the researchers did find some increases in the first diagnosis of depression for women using specific types of hormonal contraception.<br /><br />Lidegaard said past studies of women on hormonal contraception may not have found differences in depression treatment or diagnosis because women who experience mood changes after starting hormonal contraception often stop taking the pills and become non-users again.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The researchers caution that their findings are limited by several factors, though. For example, the fact that antidepressant medications are sometimes prescribed for reasons other than depression. Also, depression is listed as a potential side effect of hormonal contraception, they write, so these drugs and devices might not be prescribed as often to women already at risk, which would mean the real depression risk is higher than indicated by these results.</p>\n<div class=\"last6brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"All women, doctors and contraception advisers should realize we have this potential side effect in the use of hormonal contraceptives,\" Lidegaard said.</div>\n<div class=\"last4brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /><em><strong>Disclaimer</strong> : The views and opinions expressed by the Doctors are their independent professional judgment and we do not take any responsibility for the accuracy of their views.

Scientists at Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) led by Jackson James and a team comprising Dhanesh S.B. and Riya Ann Paul have come upon a discovery, which might help activate the quiescent stem cells inside an adult brain. This might help develop a non-invasive cure for neuro-degenerative diseases; but that&rsquo;s for later. Neural stem cells reside in a few places in the brain like the ventricular zone and hippocampus. Left to themselves, these don&rsquo;t divide, unlike how it was in the early stages of life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Scientists want to see if&nbsp; these could divide, produce the required neurons which are degenerating through the maintenance of the neural stem cell pool. &ldquo;We wanted to understand the mechanism that maintains neural stem cells and what it is that helps it to go to the next phase of a progenitor,&rdquo; says Jackson James. The neural stem cell undergoes asymmetric division, producing a differentiated cell and a daughter stem cell identical to the mother. Normally, a signalling pathway, known as notch-dependent Hes-1 pathway,&nbsp; ensures that the daughter stem cell is prevented from turning into a differentiated cell.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The notch, a protein from the progenitor, kickstarts a series of processes which finally activates Hes-1. One of the important functions of Hes-1 protein is to repress genes which are needed to make a neuron and thereby maintain the progenitor. &ldquo;Quite accidentally, we discovered that there are other factors which can induce Hes-1 activation&nbsp; in a Notch independent manner.&nbsp; In the early stages of life, chemicals, known as growth factors induced it. We have shown that neural stem cells are maintained by Notch independent Hes-1 in the developing neo-cortex and these then transit into Notch dependent Hes-1 expressing neural progenitors and latter differentiate into neurons. However, it was not known whether such a system exists in neural stem cells in an adult brain,&rdquo; says Jackson James.

An earlier research demonstrates how a survey can measure a patient's risk for and ability to tolerate financial stress.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With data from 233 patients going through treatment for advanced cancers, the researchers showed that the COST (Comprehensive Score for financial Toxicity) questionnaire identified patients at financial distress, which was found to be a \"clinically relevant patient-centered measure.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Study's lead author Jonas de Souza said, \"As expected, we found a strong association between a patient's use of health care resources and his or her sense of financial toxicity.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Adding, \"This is something we need to look for, to recognize early and make sure it does not become a barrier to care.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">More than two admissions to the hospital, had a significant impact on a patient's sense of financial toxicity. \"This is reasonable. Hospital care is much more expensive tha office-based care. We now know that it also impacts a&nbsp; patient's self-reported financial feelings,\" de Souza said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The research team kept the COST questionnaire short and simple. It includes 11 brief statements about costs, resources and concerns. For each question, patients were asked to circle one of five possible responses that help determine their level of concern.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Exposed to statements such as: \"I feel financially stressed,\" or \"My out-of-pocket medical expenses are more than I thought they would be,\" patients had to choose the answer that best described their situation. The questionnaires revealed several factors that were closely tied to financial toxicity.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Employment status was at the top of the list, followed by household income, psychological distress, the number of hospital admissions, and race. African-American individuals tended to have more financial toxicity, on average, than Caucasians.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One surprise was the lack of a perceived financial benefit from participation in clinical trials. \"Usually the maker of an innovative device or the company that supplies a new drug will pick up the costs related to the investigational drug. But that did not reduce our patients' sense of financial toxicity. We've added that to our model,\" he said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The next step is to go back to our patients and understand the factors that drive financial toxicity for each kind of cancer. \"Then we need to learn how to intervene. How can we help these patients, perhaps with financial counselors?<br />And how can we decrease the costs of what we do to treat cancer overall and, at the same time, lessen the financial burdens that fall on the patient,\" De Souza said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Adding, \"It's important to note that the financial distress identified by the COST scale captures a unique set of stressors affecting patients above and beyond the physical and psychological strains of their disease,\" notes Lauren Hersch Nicholas, PhD, a health economist at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and member of the study team.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Being able to quantify this burden is an important step towards giving patients, their families and care team the information necessary to make the best treatment decisions for each patient's situation.\" The survey was published in Cancer journal.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/dc-Cover-s8l7nsbjqqe7r5a31oejhd2nn2-201610091140481476017626122.jpeg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baab806a12cf7ee39133b8","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"financial stability"},{"text":"stability"},{"text":"health and well being"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","statsId":"57fb2f65d0e65a6a84b33405","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/health-and-wellbeing/091016/financial-toxicity-can-adversely-affect-cancer-patients-study.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-10T06:04:21.926Z","udate":"2016-10-10T06:04:21.926Z","expirydate":"2016-12-12T12:52:23.322Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T13:44:00.000Z","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","sno":12,"showEditableRow":false,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out5254.mp3","tagsForSearch":"financial stability,stability,health and well being","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Crying my heart out but I could not produce a sound. All hopes were lost. The tears in my face were covered by the rain drops. I was the one who always told her that I never wanted anyone to see me cry. But then now I wish she would open her eyes at least to see me cry and tell me not to cry.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>FEB 24 2010 17:45</strong> I felt empty. I dint have words to express myself for what I had done. She was the only one I had in my life and now I was alone. Alone once again. Yes I had told her that loneliness was something that I loved but now I felt that she could have been there with me to share the loneliness. Even my ego, my pride my aim, my achievements had left me alone. Now I know what being lonely meant. The fair face was because she was having leukemia, blood cancer. She was not able to come but still did just because I had asked her to. She had become thin not because of her gym but because she was not well. It was weak not thin. The thud while on the call was because she had fainted. And I failed to notice that. Despite all that she had come just to make me happy and what did I do? Hurt her, irritate her, and kill her.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>FEB 24 2010 15:30</strong> she was there, still as a rock. Alone in her home, in her bed. There was a sudden rush that fell as a heavy thud in my heart. And all the voices came rushing to me. She was gone, for good. A deadly cancer had taken her away from me. Her mom had told me it was cancer. But it was all over before it even started. Cursing myself I took out my chain which was a gift from her and placed it on her beautiful hands. Then with a hollow punch of pain I went near her ear and said &ldquo;I am really sorry Sam&hellip;&rdquo; and I left the place with welled up eyes and a heavy heart.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>FEB 23 2010 09:44</strong> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it I cannot take any more of your ignorance.

I tried to explain how it all was just a game. But she refused to accept it. She must hate me. Well even I was not crazy about myself at that point. I ran behind her and explain all about it but it dint seem to go anywhere.&rdquo; I woke up with a start it was all a dream. I had to apologize to her. Be with her again. So after all that wait I started for her house. To apologize in person. But the Ego restrained me. So I stayed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>FEB 22 2010 15:31</strong> it had been more than a week since I had spoken to Sam. And I was starting to feel really guilty. It was not my fault but that&rsquo;s not the point at all. It was a huge fight but now it&rsquo;s all getting on to my head. I was stupid and I should have apologized to her but I did not. It was her mistake as well. The ego dint let me move forward with the apology. I was an achiever up till then, that dint let me put my foot down. But at the end no matter whose mistake it is the distance between US increases. I dint know what would make it better. And I was torn between my feelings and my ego. Damn the ego!!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>FEB 14 2010</strong> it was the day of roses, Valentine&rsquo;s Day. I went to meet her. You know, SAM. The one and only, my beloved. I loved her so much but I felt something was wrong. I just knew it. I wanted to surprise her. I just got 100 odd candles and arranged it on the 1st floor of my house, in a small room which had lot of shelves. The candles were everywhere. And I had chosen a song called, expressions by Helen Jane so that it would be romantic. And then she came, her face was glowing more than it usually did, fair than usual she had become thin, since she was going to gym. I said &ldquo;I am not going to compare you with the moon because moon has scars etc is an old line, in one line if I have to describe you I would say you are the most beautiful girl in this planet, in one WORD if I had to say it would be &ldquo;PURE&rdquo;&rdquo;. She smiled at me. She said &ldquo;thanks a lot, this is the best thing anyone has ever done for me, you are the best.&rdquo; saying this she held my hand and gave me a silver chain. It was so good and I hugged her and looked into her eyes. but I saw that she was not happy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So I asked her me: You still like him dont you.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">her: please its valentine&rsquo;s day and after this beautiful thing why are you at it again?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Me: if you thought it was beautiful then you wouldn&rsquo;t be so dull. If you don&rsquo;t like me just say so.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Her: oh come on, you know I loved it please don&rsquo;t be angry. That anger doesn&rsquo;t go well with your face,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">me: okay m sorry too. By the way I have got us tickets for tomorrow. Morning movie then afternoon rain tree then at night a really nice play.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Her: m sorry ad I can&rsquo;t make it. I have to go to vishal&rsquo;s house remember? I told you la his cousin is getting married. I got to go to Trivandrum.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">me: Go day after tomorrow Na, please stay for tomorrow I made all the arrangements. Her: sorry da cant. I skipped today cos I know I have the best guy in the world.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Me: please please tomorrow please.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Her: sorry da pleaase understand.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Me: so you like vishal more than me? Fine!!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Her: oh come on you know that&rsquo;s not true</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">me: then stay and prove it</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">her: stop it, now</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">me: why should I? You don&rsquo;t like me anymore.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">AFTER A WHILE OF SIMILAR FIGHTS her: That&rsquo;s it I cannot take any more of your ignorance. This is no longer a relationship. It&rsquo;s always about you and you just seem to be interested about yourself. It&rsquo;s as if you never wanted me here. And it&rsquo;s me who is always pushing things and taking initiatives to keep this relationship healthy. That&rsquo;s it, I quit, FOR GOOD!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Me: Fine I am not dying for you, one day you ll die for me and then you ll know.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>FEB 9 2010 10:00</strong> I called her up in the morning she dint pick up the call. I tried many times I could not reach her. I started getting worried. And got paranoid so kept trying she dint pick up the call. Later at three in the noon she called me, and apologized for not answering the call I yelled at her but then I heard a thud as if she fell down and got worried. I was not able to reach her for some hours and then she called me again. She said that she fell down from the swing and her mobile was not working properly and she had given it for repair.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>FEB 7 2010 00:00</strong> she called me at twelve, and said &ldquo;HAPPY 5 YEAR anniversary honey&rdquo; I said thanks a lot and we spoke about our relationship till two or three o clock. But I sensed her coughing a lot and also sounding really weak. I dint want to upset her so I dint ask her about it. We kept talking and I said ok I am going to sleep I have got a match in morning. I am sorry SAM. Gunnite! She sounded sad when she said bye, but I dint say anything. And we met in the evening I was only boasting to her about my match entirely and I dint even ask her how she was and all that.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>FEB 7 2005 16:00</strong> it was after tuition that she came near me. We used to go home together pushing the cycle. In the 4 years we had become really best friends and I felt that we had gone a tad more than that. But I dint say anything. While walking she said, &ldquo;sri I need to tell you something, rather talk to you about it&rdquo; saying this she pulled my hand. Sure she thought it was romantic but my cycle fell down. She said, &ldquo;There is something I have been feeling lately. And I don&rsquo;t know what it is. I mean I think I have crossed the limits by my heart and become too close to you&rdquo; I started smiling and saying something but she interrupted &ldquo;no let me finish please. I think about you all the time and always for everything, you are the one guy I speak to this much apart from my dad. And I don&rsquo;t know what to name this relationship but it&rsquo;s not restricted to friendship. Love seems too awkward considering we are too young. I am sorry I don&rsquo;t know how to express myself. I just feel,&rdquo; I kept my finger on her lips and said, &ldquo;yes, I love you too Sam&rdquo;. Tears were filled in her eyes she was so happy and jumping with joy. This got me since I was not so attractive. She looked like an angel just even more beautiful.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>JAN 12 2004 11:45</strong> I had a bad fever and also I had my exams. I don&rsquo;t pray to god. Not that I don&rsquo;t believe in him, it&rsquo;s just that, he is there, let him be there. But she called me up and said &ldquo;how are you feeling.&rdquo; I said I was fine but was worried about fever and the exam. She said &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry I have prayed to 4 gods, I pray only to 3 gods daily but since yesterday I dint pray for myself, that is for me to get a good guy, you know with all the looks I asked for, I have that one pending so I used it for you today&hellip; You will clear the exam easily&rdquo; I dint know I would say this but I did &ldquo;Sam, I don&rsquo;t believe in god, But I believe in you when you pray for me, Thanks a lot. You will get the best guy in this world. i promise!!&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">__END__</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><em>DISCLAIMER: ALL NAMES AND INCIDENTS ARE FICTITIOUS, blah blah and more blah is mere co-incidence.</em></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><em>This post is dedicated to one person who was my best friend.

Being aware of what we eat, physical fitness, and finding a unique path to wellbeing has become essential to our lives. It is a beautiful trend, and I applaud you, too, for exploring this wonderful path of living!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yoga can help us be and feel more fit and healthier. It can add a welcome component to other types of exercise we already enjoy. Yoga has become one of my newest training aids and now is an integral part of my daily fitness routine.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many of you, dear readers&mdash;and a number of my clients and athletes I work with&mdash;seem to enjoy the practice of yoga as well. You have given me wonderful feedback about my program, &ldquo;Yoga for Performance<sup>sm</sup>.&rdquo; I thought it was time to reflect again on this ancient Indian science of exercise and healing, and discuss in more detail how to integrate it into your fitness routine.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Those of you who already are familiar with yoga probably understand its many benefits. You can find extended information in another article in the Yoga section on this Website. For now, I would like to give you a quick overview about how you may find yoga to be beneficial. I also would like to share how yoga and running can complement each other, and how yoga can support you in your efforts to be best in your favorite sport. Towards the end of the article, I will introduce you to three elements of my typical routine, and how to add yoga practice to your schedule.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The following thoughts include some of the results of my own search for the right balance in the intensity of my training, what I have learned from following yoga studies, and my own yoga routine. Yoga practice with my clients and athletes has also helped broaden my knowledge and appreciation of this physical and mental art. I hope this can provide inspiration and guidance that will help you to improve your fitness, health, and quality of life.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/DeFrisco-Yoga-Photos-007-Copy-4-948x5421476083259499.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","publisherSectionName":"takethemagicstep.com","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"harmonious relationship"},{"text":"body"},{"text":"healthy lifestyle"},{"text":"physical fitness"},{"text":"living"},{"text":"exercise"},{"text":"daily fitness routine"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","statsId":"57fb3e5bf4a3494423c656f8","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"https://www.takethemagicstep.com/yoga/yoga-for-the-right-balance/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-10T07:08:11.785Z","udate":"2016-10-10T12:21:51.513Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-10T07:07:00.000Z","publiseherSectionId":"57fb3e45f0b8064697ce9de9","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","sno":1,"showEditableRow":false,"publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out9449.mp3","tagsForSearch":"harmonious relationship,body,healthy lifestyle,physical fitness,living,exercise,daily fitness routine","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

The girl seemed overjoyed and amazed looking at all the contents that filled every corner of my little shop.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You ask for any kind and it is there. Different shapes, sizes, colours, patterns and prints. I offer customized designs too,&rdquo; I said showing one brilliant piece of my work.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tiger prints, beaded, multicoloured, backless, halter neck, strapless, printed and abstract prints. I got the craziest of ideas. I knew the choice of the girls who came in this area. In a place like Goa which attracted many foreigners and young bubbling girls, I started this as a small shop under a thatched roof beside this Kempu beach.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Seeing one girl spending more than 15 minutes in my shop her other friends followed. My happiness knew no bounds when they purchased in dozens. The same story repeated each day. I met new girls, spoke to them, took ideas from them and customized funky bikinis just the way they wanted.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I always roll into my past seeing the gleaming eyes of these girls.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I used to accompany my father when he went fishing. Afternoon school kept me occupied until I found time to play with girls I grew up with. The only sport known to us was swimming and diving into the cool blue sea that always seemed to welcome us. My mother decked me up in those beautiful swimming costumes that she stitched only for me. Those bits and pieces of cloth that she had named as my swimming costume are now the so called &lsquo;bikini&rsquo;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Things were not the same always. Sitting by the beach I used to admire the girls who still went swimming without me. I sat on the warm sand at dusk noticing my friends who had grown up just like me. They played in the pool, enjoyed teasing other guys wearing the sarong or flaunting their sexy body with that beautiful piece of cloth which once used to be our swimming costume.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was enveloped with fear then thinking I could never be one among them. My parents tried their best but I never found my confidence back. Negative energy seemed to have enveloped me. With time, the scars healed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I just sat in one corner helping my mother with her stitching sessions each day. This fascination took over me and turned into public attraction in a short while.&nbsp; My thoughts had a new dimension.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After years I can say I am contented.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>***</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><code><strong>The article read</strong> &ndash; <em>Sherin is a Breast Cancer survivor from the past 40 years who has dedicated her life to brighten up the lives of young women.</em></code></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;***</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I threw the last bit of the dry peanut skin, dusted the paper, folded it carefully and putting it in my pocket I headed towards the shop that had a big board <code><strong>&ldquo;BIKINIS ONLY&rdquo; </strong></code>written in bold over it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">__END__</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/bikini-lady1476084116496.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"bikini and me"},{"text":"goa"},{"text":"short moral story"},{"text":"archana"},{"text":"kempu beach"},{"text":"breast cancer"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://yourstoryclub.com/short-stories-social-moral/short-story-with-moral-lesson-bikini-and-me/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-10T07:22:04.479Z","udate":"2016-12-17T11:13:00.611Z","expirydate":"2017-10-10T07:21:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-10T07:21:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","publiseherSectionId":"57fb3c06d0e65a6a84b334e0","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fb419c2040d36ae07b7882","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6461.mp3","audioImageUrl":"","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"tagsForSearch":"bikini and me,goa,short moral story,archana,kempu beach,breast cancer","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Her hand reached out for the last croissant; &ldquo;STOP&rdquo; said her mind, &ldquo;PLEASE&rdquo; begged the nineteen year old heart. She could feel the tires around her waist, weighing her down, emotionally and physically. She pulled her arm back, eyeing the lush croissant, which would have been hers, only if she had not decided to follow her dream, a dream so far fetched, which seemed nearly impossible.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But there she was, she wanted it, and wanted it bad, a fantasy of a teenager to fit into the beautiful peacock green bikini. A trip had been planned, to the city of beaches, by her huge group of friends, and the trip included her. She used to sit dejected listening to her slim friends discuss about the kind of clothes they have purchased, and how short each of their skirts were, and how beautiful they looked. She wanted to be among them discussing her size, and see their expression change from surprise to admiration; and so she decided.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Up and down, back and forth, her life jolted by vigorous gym sessions, her scale; her worst nightmare smiled at her happily, as it moved away from the bigger numbers, bit by bit, slow but steady. She was overjoyed, she felt it, from within, as she stood in front of the mirror, analysing her reflection, measuring her inches. Click opened her wardrobe, and proudly hung the bikini, but it wasn&rsquo;t time. She removed it admiringly, stroked the fabric, and visualized herself on the shore of a beach, flaunting her curves, bikini clad.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Her thoughts were interrupted by the knock at her bedroom door. She heard her mother scream out for her, it was time for supper, and back she was with her bowl of assorted vegetables and her best entertainer, the television. She zapped, ate, zapped, reaching for the last lettuce leaf in her bowl, only realising her stomach craved for something extra. It frustrated her that she could feast on her favourite fried chicken, mashed potatoes, Oreo biscuits or additional helpings of Hazelnut Choco spread. She had been through this a dozen times, but this time it was different, she wanted to be someone else, someone popular, and someone that made heads turn. She had to compromise, and so she did, with a little reluctance once in a while, but a whole new chapter of determination. She wanted to be the topic of harmless gossip among the ones in school; she wanted to be out dating on Saturdays, partying on Sundays, shopping in skimpy outfits, which she had dreaded to wear till now.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Weeks passed, her patience started to die away, she once in a while treated herself with an ice cream, the fat was stubborn and refused to melt fast, but the time did. No matter how less she ate, she still looked awfully plump, which annoyed her and she was ready to call it quits. She sat on her fluffy bed and wept an entire evening, ignoring her dinner. Her tears dried up, leaving her cheeks cold, she lay down on her bed staring at the ceiling, letting random thoughts pass by her mind.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She hadn&rsquo;t realised but her bedroom was hot and stuffy, she leapt out of her bed to open the windows. The wind blew into her round pale face. She stared outside her window, and watched a mother treading along the footpath along with her son. The boy would have easily been older than twelve, the woman looked very familiar; maybe she was someone from her apartment. She watched closely as the son held on to his mother&rsquo;s saree and plodded along with her. His head bent, in an awkward gait, made him look a bit abnormal. She closely watched them enter the apartment; they stopped to talk to another mother, who also had a teenage son but a much normal looking one. Standing near the window on the ground floor and only a few meters away from them, she could overhear their conversations, though she had to strain her ears a little. The usual small talk, recipe exchange, and the latest saree in fashion, bored her and as she stepped away from the window, she heard one of the lady say something about a special school.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She immediately turned towards them and observed the mother of the abnormal, waiting for her to react, in a furious way, or probably a wretched expression. On the contrary, her face blossomed and she began raving about her son&rsquo;s painting skills, and his ability to play the guitar even without learning.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The middle aged woman added, &ldquo;My child is special, and every child is god&rsquo;s gift. It&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;matter what&rsquo;s on the outside, inner self is what matters.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Standing in her bedroom, through the window she gazed at the boy playing with a Rubik&rsquo;s cube, his tongue curving as per each turn of the cube and his eyes fixed on the colourful object. She ran to her closet and saw the beautiful looking bikini sitting inside. She took one last look at it and stuffed it inside the top shelf. She looked at herself in the mirror and, her flesh noticeably bulging out from her denim, and her belly sagging down. She met her eyes&rsquo; reflection and said the words aloud, &ldquo;I am a beautiful person.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She smiled at herself and looked around her bedroom, her space where she became what she was; where ideas, thoughts, desires and hopes were given birth to, and where she found her true self.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">__END__</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/specially_abled1476085013805.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"tape it"},{"text":"ranjini"},{"text":"short moral story"},{"text":"specially abled"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://yourstoryclub.com/short-stories-social-moral/short-story-with-moral-lesson-tape-it/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-10T07:37:00.918Z","udate":"2016-12-17T11:12:09.829Z","expirydate":"2017-10-10T07:37:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-09T18:30:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","publiseherSectionId":"57fb3c06d0e65a6a84b334e0","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fb451c38939368e0c04f84","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out5743.mp3","audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"tape it,ranjini,short moral story,specially abled","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

{"_id":"57fb74d2b38e1d5d6a0c487c","title":"An Ecological View of Ancient India","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>History and Ecology</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ecology is beginning to define how we look at the world and how we look at ourselves. Each geographical region in the world constitutes a special ecosystem &ndash; an interrelated habitat for plants and animals shaped by climate and terrain. These ecological factors have a strong effect on culture as well.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As part of nature ourselves, society arises out of an ecological basis that we cannot ignore. Most of civilization, both in its advance and decline, reflects how people are able to manage the ecosystems in which they live and their natural resources. Human culture derives largely from its first culture, which is agriculture, our ability to work the land. This depends largely on water, particularly fresh water that is found in rivers, and flat land that can be easily irrigated.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, so far we have looked at history mainly in a non-ecological way, trying to define it according to political, economic or racial concerns. Our account of ancient history, particularly that of India, has not afforded an adequate regard to ecological factors. It has put too much weight on migration, as if culture came from the outside, rather than on the characteristics and necessities of the ecosystems in which people live and must rely upon for developing their way of life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Aryan invasion theory is such a product of the pre-ecological age of historical theory that emphasized the movements of peoples over the natural development of culture within well-defined geographical regions. Nineteenth century thought, the product of a colonial age, found it easy to see culture as something brought in by intruders, rather than as developed by the inhabitants of a region who had to develop unique methods to harness their natural resources as shaped by the ecology around them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Ancient River Civilizations and India, the Land of the Rivers</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is a well known fact that the main civilizations of the ancient world of Egypt, Mesopotamia, India (Indus Valley), and China were only possible because of the great river systems around which they developed. The rivers made these civilizations possible, not simply human invention or any special ethnic type who migrated there.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If we examine these four great riverine centers of early civilization it is clear that the largest and most ideal river region in the world for developing civilization is India. Egypt grew up around one great river, the Nile that flowed through what was otherwise a dry, rainless desert. Mesopotamia had two rivers but only of moderate size, the Tigris and Euphrates, flowing through a large desert as well. Both Egypt and Mesopotamia were in subtropical regions that provided abundant warmth and sunshine for crops, but otherwise suffered from the limited size of their one or two river banks that were their sole steady. China had one large but unpredictable river, the Yellow River, which frequently overflowed it banks in various floods. It also received abundant rain. But it was centered in a cold northern region, with a limited growing season.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">India, on the other hand, had a massive nexus of numerous great rivers from the Indus in the West to the swamplands of the Gangetic delta in the East. It had both a warm subtropical climate and seasonal abundant rains. This river region included relatively dry regions of the northwest to the very wet regions of eastern India affording an abundance of crops both in type and quantity. The Indian river system was much larger in size and arable land, and better in climate than perhaps all the other three river regions put together. No other region of the world could so easily serve to create an agricultural diversity or the cultural richness that would go with it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ecologically speaking, north India was the ideal place in the world for the development of a riverine civilization via agriculture. Bounded by the Himalayas in the north, and mountains on the West, East and South, this north Indian river plain is a specific geographical region and ecosystem, whose natural boundaries could easily serve to create and hold together a great civilization. It was also ideal for producing large populations that depend upon agriculture for their sustenance.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This same network of rivers was ideal for communication. Not surprisingly, the Rig Veda, the oldest book of the region, is full of praise for the numerous great rivers of the region, the foremost of which in early ancient times was the Sarasvati, which flowed east of the Yamuna into the Rann of Kachchh, creating an unbroken set of fertile rivers from the Punjab to Bengal. This Vedic Goddess of speech was a river goddess. The Vedic idea of One Truth but many paths (Rigveda I.164) probably reflects this experience of life of many rivers linked to the one sea.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Need for An Ecological View of India&rsquo;s History</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The main point of this article is that if we really want to understand the development of civilization in ancient India we cannot ignore such ecological and geographical factors. Ancient India was the ideal ecological region for the development of civilization in the ancient world. Therefore, we should look to an indigenous development of civilization in the region. We need not import its people, animals, plants, culture or civilization from the outside, particularly from barren and inhospitable Central Asia, for example, which would not have been suitable to India and which is separated from it geographically by very hard to cross mountain and desert barriers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We need to take a new ecological look at the Vedas, which so far has not been examined adequately ecologically but has been approached mainly according to linguistic, Marxist or Freudian concerns that easily miss the obvious geography or ecology of the text. If we do this, we will discover that even the oldest Vedic text, the Rig Veda, clearly describes a region of many vast rivers flowing to the sea, the most important of which was the Sarasvati. The climate that it describes of great rains and monsoons, the symbolism of the great God Indra, is also clearly that of India. The flora and fauna mentioned including the Brahma bull, water buffalo and elephant and its sacred trees of the Pipal, Ashvatta and Shamali is also that of India.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The fall of the Indus or Harappan culture, just as was the case for many in the ancient world, was owing to ecological factors, something that nineteenth and early twentieth century migrationist views of history completely missed. It occurred not because of the destruction wrought by the proposed Aryan invaders but by ecological changes brought about by the drying up of the Sarasvati River around 1900 BCE. This didn&rsquo;t end civilization in the region but caused its relocation mainly to the more certain waters of the Ganga to the east. Such a movement is reflected in the shift from Vedic literature that is centered on the Sarasvati to the Puranic literature that is centered on the Ganges.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The great Indian river system from the Panjab to Bihar is perhaps the greatest breadbasket or agricultural center in the world. Any humans in the region would have been aided by the land, the waters and the climate, affording them a great advantage in the development of language and culture as well. The natural resources provided by the riverine ecosystem of north India could uphold great civilizations over the centuries. From it the peoples and literature of the region had adequate support from nature to sustain their traditions.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Southern River Regions</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The type of civilization developed in the rivers of north India could easily connect with the cultures developing on the rivers in the south of the country that shared a common climate and geographical ties. The other main great river region for India is the basins of the Krishna and Godavari rivers in the southeast of India, particularly Andhra Pradesh. This provides another important agricultural center in the ancient world, which has also not been examined properly.<br />Another important river area is the Narmada and Tapti rivers in Gujarat and Maharashtra. As these were nearby the delta of the Sarasvati, they could have been an extension of it (which is perhaps why the Bhrigu Rishis of this region are so important in Vedic literature).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That the civilization of north India could have had connections with these southern cultures is also ecologically based. For this we must consider the ecological factors that existed when agriculture began to arise in the world around 10,000 BCE. Before the end of the Ice Age north India was much drier and cooler in climate. This means that if there was any pre-Ice Age basis for agriculture in north India it would have more likely come from these more suitable southern river regions which had better rainfall at that time.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We need to look at the civilization of India according to geographical and ecological imperatives that are far more certain than historical speculation conditioned by simplistic ideas of ethnicity, linguistics or migrations. In this regard the study of the Sarasvati river system by the geologists of India and linking it to the Sarasvati in Vedic literature is probably the key.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />Civilization is like a plant that owes its existence to the land on which it grows. We cannot ignore this important fact either for our past or for our future. The current government of India plans to link all the great rivers of the country represents such a responsible ecological approach which, including reconstituting the old Sarasvati river channel, links the great future of the country with its great past.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/ancient_india_map1476097226903.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"ecology"},{"text":"history"},{"text":"civilization"},{"text":"india"},{"text":"ancient"},{"text":"view"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57fb6fc4e66f216b816f52ca","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"https://vedanet.com/2012/06/14/an-ecological-view-of-ancient-india/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-10T11:00:34.128Z","udate":"2016-10-10T12:34:33.412Z","expirydate":"2017-01-10T10:55:36.559Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-10T12:34:00.000Z","publiseherSectionId":"57f4eba09d620a1ad4af01ca","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fb74d2b38e1d5d6a0c487e","id":"57fb74d2b38e1d5d6a0c487c","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out4593.mp3","tagsForSearch":"ecology,history,civilization,india,ancient,view","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

{"_id":"57fb879ecf43e7684271563d","title":"Malgudi Revisited: R K Narayan, the Master Storyteller Who Enchanted a Nation","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fa234a4ac2d218b1a52","content":"<p>&ldquo;Malgudi is where we all belong, and where we wish we lived.&rdquo;- R.K.Narayan<br /><br />Had he still been alive, R.K. Narayan would have been 110 years old today. Renowned for his stories set in the fictional town of Malgudi in South India, Rasipuram KrishnaswamiIyer Narayanaswami, was one of the most celebrated English novelists of India. Marked by simplicity and a subtle humour, R.K. Narayan told stories of ordinary people trying to live their simple lives in a changing world.<br /><br />Born into a large Brahmin family in Madras (now Chennai) in 1906, Narayan came to live in Mysore as a teenager in the 1920s, when his father was appointed headmaster of the Maharaja&rsquo;s Collegiate High School. Always a small towner at heart, Narayan loved Mysore, with its easy-going, chatty, intellectual vibe and a strong sense of its own identity. In his 1974 memoir, My Days, he wrote.<br /><br />&ldquo;If Socrates or Plato were alive, they would have felt at home in Sayyaji Rao Road and would have carried on their dialogues at the Station Square.&rdquo;<br /><br />After graduating in 1930 from the Maharaja&rsquo;s College, Narayan took up his first job as the Mysore correspondent for a Madras newspaper, the Justice. His daily news-hunting walks through the city would later lay the foundation for his Malgudi chronicles.<br /><br />In 1935, R.K. Narayan&rsquo;s first novel Swami and Friends was published with the help of the famous British writer, Graham Greene. He followed it up with its successor, The Bachelor of Arts, which was also set in the enchanting fictional town of Malgudi. From then onward, the writer never looked back &ndash; he wrote 29 novels, all based in Malgudi, and numerous other short stories.<br /><br />An ardent admirer of R.K. Narayan&rsquo;s Malgudi Days, Graham Greene once said,<br />&ldquo;Whom next shall I meet in Malgudi? That is the thought that comes to me when I close a novel of Mr Narayan&rsquo;s. I do not wait for another novel. I wait to go out of my door into those loved and shabby streets and see with excitement and a certainty of pleasure a stranger approaching, past the bank, the cinema, the haircutting saloon, a stranger who will greet me I know with some unexpected and revealing phrase that will open a door on to yet another human existence.&rdquo;<br /><br />Greene later wrote,<br />&ldquo;Narayan wakes in me a spring of gratitude. Without him, I could never have known what it is like to be Indian.&rdquo;<br /><br />R.K. Narayan&rsquo;s description of Malgudi was so meticulously realistic that the reader would often feel that she had literally visited the place herself. Such was the charm of the provincial world created by his words that critics would compare the literary microcosm of Malgudi to William Faulkner&rsquo;s Yoknapatawpha County, a small town that the author created so that he would be able to freely meddle with its geography and details as he pleased, without incurring the wrath of the residents of any actual town or place.<br /><br />The stories set in Malgudi are a meandering south Indian soap opera, full of small-town intrigues and aspirations, which were successfully adapted for an Indian television series in the 1980s.<br /><br />Early in the 80s, director Shankar Nag handed John Devraj, a sculptor, musician, art director and town planner, a sheet of paper. It was the script for Malgudi Days, based on R.K. Narayan&rsquo;s stories set in the fictional town. From the words on that page, Devraj, was asked to recreate Malgudi in Agumbe, a tiny village in the Malnad region of Karnataka.<br /><br />Readers had long searched for the actual Malgudi, sure that such a vibrant place could not be a figment of imagination. And in the 80s, thanks to the mercurial genius of Shankar Nag and the artistic talent of John Devraj,&nbsp; Malgudi finally found a real-life location: Agumbe. With its misty hills, stormy downpours, old world homes and quiet streets, the tiny tropical village was perfect as the make-believe Malgudi.<br />Child actor Manjunath, a wide-eyed boy with a beaming smile captured the hearts of all as Swami, a 10-year-old boy with too vivid an imagination, and a peculiar genius for always being in a scrape.<br /><br />The locals all played parts in the serial and all the episodes were shot in actual settings in Agumbe: in the 115-year-old &lsquo;Dodda Mane&rsquo; (Big House) that served as Swami&rsquo;s house, the wide open tracts of land that served as Swami&rsquo;s cricket ground, and the jungles where Swami gets lost and misses the all-important MCC (Malgudi Cricket Club) match. The created saloon, the sweet shop, the post office, the denizens of Malgudi walking in and out of the frame &ndash; Agumbe had it all, the Malgudi that everyone wanted to be a part of.<br /><br />A sleepy rain-soaked hamlet, Agumbe is today a place where time has tried to stay still. The cameras aren&rsquo;t around anymore, but it feels as though the people from Narayan&rsquo;s fantasy world never moved out of the quaint village. Sunsets are enchanting here, and on a clear day one can even see the distant Arabian Sea on the horizon.<br /><br />A key location where the crew spent months on end is Dodda Mane, a private home built in 1900 that has a grand pillared verandah and a central courtyard. Visitors are warmly greeted by Kasturi akka, the matron of the house, and offered a meal of&nbsp; local snacks and kashayam, a milky, lightly spiced local beverage. Settling down in the verandah, Kasturi akka tells of how the Malgudi Days shooting turned the house upside down, regaling visitors with trivia about the house and village. She then informs visitors that they are free to look around and take pictures but they must keep the doors of the rooms upstairs closed lest monkeys have a free run in there.<br /><br />Born out of a master storyteller&rsquo;s imagination, Malgudi was a rare literary phenomenon where the reader fell in love with both the novel&rsquo;s hero, and the locale. &ldquo;Where is Malgudi?&rdquo; was a question R.K. Narayan was asked many times in his life, and he ducked it in a variety of ways. As he once, in one of his more enigmatic answers, says &ndash; &ldquo;Malgudi is where we all belong, and where we wish we lived.&rdquo;</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/01481968854009.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"novelist"},{"text":"Literature"},{"text":"indian novelist"},{"text":"malgudi"},{"text":"RK Narayan"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd191afb61356b41a1bb48","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thebetterindia.com/71122/r-k-narayan-tribute-malgudi-days/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-10T12:20:46.887Z","udate":"2017-01-19T11:23:54.802Z","expirydate":"2018-04-19T18:30:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fb879ecf43e7684271563f","id":"57fb879ecf43e7684271563d","publishedOn":"2016-12-17T10:03:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out2681.mp3","audioImageUrl":"","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"tagsForSearch":"novelist,Literature,indian novelist,malgudi,RK Narayan"}

Photo: Mail Today\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It all began six months ago when Sanjaya Baru was in Hyderabad for a lecture. He asked his audience what they remember about 1991. They all said in unison that the year was significant for economic reforms. But when asked about who initiated these reforms, most people took the name of <a href=\"http://indiatoday.intoday.in/people/manmohan-singh/17941.html\">Manmohan Singh</a>. Some even credited P Chidambaram and Kamal Nath.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No one mentioned PV Narasimha Rao. Ironically, this incident took place in Hyderabad, which was Rao's own city,\" recalls Baru explaining why he wrote the book, 1991: How PV Narasimha Rao Made History. \"After the lecture was over, several business leaders present at the venue urged me to write a book on Rao's role in India's economic reforms.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Baru believes Rao's contribution is forgotten due to two factors. \"One, he faced several corruption cases, especially towards the fag end of his rule. But most importantly, the Congress decided to erase the memory of Narasimha Rao, to make the point that no person from outside the family can ever be a successful PM. After all, what did Rao prove? He proved that someone doesn't need to be related to the Nehru-Gandhi family to be a successful prime minister. By becoming the first PM outside the family to run the country for full term, he effectively challenged this notion.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The author, however, says that acknowledging Rao's role doesn't in any way belittle Manmohan Singh's contributions. \"Singh was the intellectual face of the reform process. Rao had repeatedly said how much he depended on Singh. When Chidambaram resigned, Rao accepted it. When Madhavrao Scindia resigned, he accepted it. But when Singh resigned, not once but three times, he refused to accept the resignation. That shows Rao's regard for him.</p>\n<div class=\"storycentimg\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<div><img title=\"\" src=\"http://media2.intoday.in/indiatoday/images/stories//2016September/09fir24-4_100916013255.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\" /></div>\n<h2 class=\"mos-caption\">1991: How PV Narasimha Rao Made History by Sanjaya Baru; Aleph, Rs.499. Photo: Mail Today</h2>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But the author emphasises that a finance minister-or for that matter any minister-can work as much as the PM allows him to do. He quotes Narasimha Rao as saying that a \"finance minister is like the numerical zero. Its power depends on the number you place in front of it.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Baru believes that Rao's time had come. \"He could have been PM even if Rajiv was alive. It's based on some data analysed by India Today and PTI of the 1991 elections. Both came to the conclusion that if one takes the voting result of the first phase of polling, when Rajiv Gandhi was still alive, and projects it in the second and the third phase, then the Congress would not be able to form the government. Rajiv would not have got the numbers. Such was his image that no one from outside the party would have supported him either. In this scenario, Rao would have been the best bet to lead the Congress-led coalition.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to Baru, Rao's family background also helped him initiate economic reforms fearlessly. \"Rajiv Gandhi, born in an affluent, illustrious family, was worried about his image of being pro-rich. Rao had no such dilemmas. He was not afraid of being called pro-business or pro-rich-because he wasn't rich. This explains why Rao is the only PM who has given Bharat Ratna to a business leader, JRD Tata,\" explains he.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One more field where Rao hasn't been given his due is foreign affairs. \"Very few people acknowledge that Rao was the first PM to visit South Korea. Today, Indian market is being flooded with South Korean companies and products. Rao's pragmatism can also be gauged from the fact that his first foreign trip was to Germany. And his was the first Indian government to recognise Israel,\" says the author.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Baru has one final regret, though. \"Rao should have been given Bharat Ratna by now. Sadly, even Manmohan Singh failed to get him this,\" says he. One hopes when this \"reluctant liberaliser\", as some of his critics call him, gets this award, it's not politicised. For, Rao is vastly misunderstood and he still awaits his Boswell.</p>\n<p><!-- Add your site or application content here --></p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/09fir24-4_1009160132551476103155463.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babf5fcabe7a5704419130","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"sanjaya baru"},{"text":"pv narasimha rao"},{"text":"manmohan singh"},{"text":"1991: how pv narasimha rao made history"},{"text":"nehru-gandhi family"},{"text":"chidambaram"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd191afb61356b41a1bb48","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/narasimha-rao-ex-indian-prime-minister-misuderstood-1991-sanjaya-baru-lifest/1/783634.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-10T12:39:20.961Z","udate":"2016-12-17T10:55:23.370Z","expirydate":"2017-10-10T12:39:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fb8bf82040d36ae07b7d44","publishedOn":"2016-10-10T12:41:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out2382.mp3","audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"sanjaya baru,pv narasimha rao,manmohan singh,1991: how pv narasimha rao made history,nehru-gandhi family,chidambaram","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57fc771838939368e0c05604","title":"A massacre on a dusty Iraqi plain and its poetic remembrance","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A small band of prominent people, including women and children, refusing allegiance to the ruler, were forcibly confined on a dusty plain for over a week, refused access to water, and eventually all the men were massacred. But it didn't end there, with the episode causing an irrevocable split in a new religion, unleashing further cycles of violence (which haven't abated even now) and still capable of raising strong emotions even 13 centuries later -- due to a poetic form which recreates the victims' agony.<br /><br />There was no doubt about the outcome of the Battle of Karbala, outside the eponymous Iraqi town, around 100 km south of Baghdad, in 681 A.D as Hussain, grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, with 70-odd men, faced a huge force sent by Umayyad Caliph Yazid. It culminated eventually with Hussain's death on the 10th of Muharram (October 10, 681) -- subsequently termed '<br /><br />Ashura' and sombrely marked by all Muslims, both Sunnis and Shias -- though the latter have special congregations and processions -- and even others. (Ashura, in India, is on October 12 this year).<br /><br />There are many fascinating stories associated with Karbala, not the least about the band of Hindus involved in the conflict, or rather its aftermath -- that of forebears of my own community, the Datts/Dattas, who take pride in being termed Hussaini Brahmins, and some of whom still follow Muharram traditions.<br /><br />More pervasive is a poetic form which keeps alive the tribulations and fate of Hussain and his followers -- the Marsiya (an elegy with an element of the dirge), which derives from ancient Arabic and Persian literary traditions, but came into its own during the Safavid era (1524-1722) in Iran.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://www.ians.in/stories/2016/Oct/09/Asif.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the Indian subcontinent for ages, they were first reported from the Deccan in the 17th century where they were not only composed by the penultimate Qutub Shahi ruler of Golconda, Abdullah Qutub Shah, his Adil Shahi contemporary -- and also penultimate ruler Ali Adil Shah II of Bijapur, but also Ram Rao 'Saiva' Bijapuri, and Swami Prashad 'Asghar', among others. <br /><br />When the tradition reached the north, it was initially not thought of much. As Lucknow's incomparable biographer Abdul Haleem 'Sharar' dryly notes that \"Marsiyas were so scantily valued in the world of poetry that there was a saying, 'a down-at-heel poet turns to composing marsiyas'\".<br /><br />But two poets of Lucknow changed the perception and took the form to unsurpassed heights. And then the saying became, \"Aan ki aan, Mir Ali marsiya-khwan.\"<br /><br />Near contemporaries, Mir Babar Ali 'Anis' (1802-1874), and Mirza Salamat Ali 'Dabir' (1803-1875), were born outside -- Faizabad and Delhi -- but raised and flourished in Lucknow. But behind them were two other men: Anis' father Mir Khaliq and Dabir's \"ustad\" Mir Zameer, who developed the standard -- a prolonged collection of six-line verses in an AAAABB rhyme-scheme.<br /><br />These two are also credited with devising the constituents - \"Chehra\" (or prelude, with descriptions of the night before or morning of the battle, or the hardships); \"Sarapa\", a description of the hero; \"Rukhsat\", the leave-taking; \"Aamad\", the entry onto the battlefield; \"Rajaz\", martial prowess of Hussain, or his half-brother Abbas; \"Jang\", or the battle itself; \"Shahdat\", the martyrdom, and finally, \"Bain\" or lament.<br /><br />Anis and Dabir proved to be worthy successors. Unfortunately, space doesn't allow citing examples as a Marsiya would be twice the length of this piece and isolated couplets will not make sense.<br /><br />Urdu scholar Mohammad Hussain Azad, in his \"Aab-e-Hayat\" (1880), the first history of Urdu letters, holds Anis was distinguished by \"limpidity of speech, beauty of description, and pleasure of idiom\", while Dabir displayed \"grandeur of words, high flight, and newness of themes\".<br /><br />For Sharar, while Dabir displayed a \"grandeur of language, lofty ideas and great erudition\", Anis had \"fine attributes of simplicity, frankness and human allurement that cannot be learned but are obtained only from the Almighty\", and also excelled in recital.<br /><br />Both Anis and Dabir also gave an Indian touch, especially Anis, who freely used Persian, Hindi, Arabic, and Sanskrit words, while the heroic protagonists have the speech and appearance of Lakhnavi nobles.<br /><br />While Anis' fame has outlasted that of Dabir, both, right from their times, had their own devoted adherents. And not only was the tradition continued in their own families for generations, but inspired many others including the likes of Munshi Channoo Lal, Raja Balwan Singh, son of ousted Maharaja of Benares, Chait Singh, Lala Ram Prasad \"Basha\", who is even buried in Karbala, and Lala Har Prashad who didn't write, but had recited Marsiyas passionately.<br /><br />Closer to our time was Kalidas Gupta \"Raza\", an authority on Ghalib but also on Marsiyas and its Hindu exponents.<br /><br />Karbala is perhaps the best example of how religious martyrs can unite, not divide</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/Karbala1476163345740.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"battle of karbala"},{"text":"iraq"},{"text":"prophet muhammad"},{"text":"muslims"},{"text":"sunnis"},{"text":"shias"},{"text":"iran"},{"text":"safavid era"},{"text":"religious martyrs"},{"text":"ghalib"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd191afb61356b41a1bb48","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.ians.in/index.php?param=news/C-1-834654","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-11T05:22:32.267Z","udate":"2016-12-17T09:50:37.980Z","expirydate":"2017-10-11T05:22:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-11T05:22:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fc771838939368e0c05606","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out1784.mp3","audioImageUrl":"","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"tagsForSearch":"battle of karbala,iraq,prophet muhammad,muslims,sunnis,shias,iran,safavid era,religious martyrs,ghalib","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

He got a matching organ after a long wait and doctors headed by Jose Chacko Periappuram at Lisie Hospital, Kochi, successfully performed heart transplant though he was in a precarious condition after multiple ventricular arrhythmias leading to multi-organ dysfunction. He was in the intensive care unit for last few weeks after diagnosed with Ischemic cardiomyopathy, advised for a transplant. Heart of Sanjose, who succumbed to serious head injury in a road accident, has been transplanted to Jithesh.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sanjose's parents readily agreed to donate their son&rsquo;s organ, and doctors reached Pushpagiri Hospital Thiruvalla on early Monday morning to harvest his heart, which was transported to Lisie Hospital in an hour. The doctors faced many challenges, and the successful transplant was a great achievement for them. Earlier, doctors established ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) to stabilise him for the transplant, but his condition didn&rsquo;t improve. After consultation with national and international faculty, they put him on CentriMag (biventricular assist device) and the complicated procedure performed under the leadership of Dr Periappuram.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, doctors were concerned about the short duration of support this system could give (30 days maximum) and the difficulties which could be encountered during the transplant.

An attractive face definitely makes a man irresistible to women. A tough and chiseled jawline implies vigour and youth. A strong jawline is also proof of a good bone structure. But, aesthetically speaking, a prominent jawline is about having a visible mandibular border which is straight from the mandibular angle to the chin point. The jawlines of Cristiano Ronaldo and Hugh Jackman are considered model jaw lines for men.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For the longest time, enhancing your jawline entailed arduous surgical treatments, owing to which a lot of people remained averse to the idea. However, a few simple methods offered with the help of botox and juvederm fillers are all you need!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An enhancement is carried out along with a chin correction &ndash; if patients have a small, receding chin. If someone desires a chiseled jaw, then the chin and the jaw&rsquo;s middle and angular areas need to be taken into account.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Injectable filler products of different types are used to enhance the jaw. As far as the treatment matters, small volumes of dermal filler gel are injected at different places along the jawline. The process has the capability to change the area&rsquo;s contours as skin is filled inside out. The jawline thus looks rejuvenated and well defined. As far as a bulky jaw is concerned, botox can be used to make it slimmer. Botox is able to block impulses, which are sent to muscles via nerves. The surgeon can use Botox injections in small doses on facial muscles that are very active, in order to make the jawline chiseled.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">These non-surgical methods usually have a temporary effect which stay on for nearly two years.&nbsp; They cost anywhere from `10-12,000 per session. Botox and fillers when combined can offer the ideal aesthetic jawline. When administered into the desired area, hyaluronic acid based fillers add volume to it, making it look more pronounced in people who have a thinner jaw. In others, who lack definition, the fillers can be used to offer better results. At the same time relaxing the muscle (Plathysma), which pulls the face down is a gentle way to improve&nbsp; a pulled-down face. Botox injection is able to pull up the skin, thus resulting in a more prominently defined jaw. Botox is also capable of reducing the muscle size and creates a slimmer jaw line.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A mixed treatment is helpful for patients who desire exceptional results. They are provided various options by aesthetic physicians and can select the one that suits their requirements the most. Patients also have the option to select the temporary methods at the initial stage and think more about the procedures after witnessing the effects.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>The writer is a Bengaluru-based&nbsp; cosmetologist</strong></em></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/jawline1476239599917.jpeg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baab806a12cf7ee39133b8","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"cosmetologists"},{"text":"jawline"},{"text":"bone structure"},{"text":"mandibular border"},{"text":"mandibular angle"},{"text":"surgical treatments"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/fashion-and-beauty/121016/enjawy-a-new-appeal.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-12T02:33:31.387Z","udate":"2016-10-12T06:33:35.769Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-12T06:33:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fda0fbcf43e76842715ddf","id":"57fda0fbcf43e76842715ddd","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","tagsForSearch":"cosmetologists,jawline,bone structure,mandibular border,mandibular angle,surgical treatments","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Mundane human logic usually takes a backseat and free-flowing imagination takes over. Tim Poston&rsquo;s latest read is a similar experience.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Called &lsquo;The Living Labyrinth&rsquo;, it takes the reader on a journey with six trainees belonging to the Starfolk community, who have been shipwrecked on a strange land on their first training mission.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An extended voyage out in space where all they can damage is themselves and in a very expensive Da Silva starship, they find themselves desperate to get back home, explains Poston. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re very green and bright and they find themselves stranded dealing with the complexities of the new and strange planet. They need to survive it in order to become inter galactic citizens.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And that&rsquo;s not all, he adds. &ldquo;Along the way, the reader meets a fanatic high priest and his subtle chaplain, a circus performer; a gang of female slaves, an acquisitive queen and some naive rebels, two opposing generals; the mysterious Cavern Dwellers and some very surprised people back home.&rdquo;</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Previously called the &lsquo;Vegetable Connection&rsquo;, Poston has been working on this novel for almost four decades along with co-author Ian Stewart, who is a mathematician and author as well. &ldquo;We have been writing this novel for forty years and have greatly improved in the last three! &rdquo; he says excitedly.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tim&rsquo;s roots in writing go deep. A schoolboy of eight, flabbergasted with his assignment that demanded he write a serious story, Tim decided to just go with his gut and write a story along the lines of a comic book that he had read. To his surprise, he ended up with a pretty good story that not only got him through the assignment but also instilled in him a confidence to write more.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He&rsquo;s been writing ever since. Mathematician, scientist and author, the now 71-year-old Poston has not looked back since. With an aura of a magician, he is best known for his book on catastrophe theory, called &lsquo;Catastrophe Theory and its Applications&rsquo;, published in 1978, which is still in print after a third of a century.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you&rsquo;re one of those that have heated arguments with an author (in your minds), this book is a must-read for you, he said. &ldquo;For someone who never argues in their head with an author, this book will probably bore them, but for someone who likes to reason on scientific and engineering issues in an adventurous setting, it will be exciting.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He is currently working on the sequel to &lsquo;The Living Labyrinth&rsquo;, called the &lsquo;Rockstar&rsquo; which is set to hit the stands soon. It provides a background to the story, elaborating more about the planet that technology came from and the effect of reconnecting with the rest of humanity.

The enterprising lad, with his sight set on bigger things, tells us more...</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wanting the graph between time spent and the money made linear in art, Rohaan tells us how the idea sprouted. &ldquo;I observed that art has always been a field of extremes. Artists either make a lot of money or nothing at all. This was truly saddening as a lot of people steer away from treading the path because of the same reason. Hence, the idea was to get artistically inclined people to do a job they love while simultaneously immortalising memories,&rdquo; enthuses Rohaan, who goes on to add, &ldquo;I was travelling across Cambodia, looking at poverty and then the talent, which existed in handicrafts/arts. It was deeply inspiring to see talented individuals who don&rsquo;t know how to market themselves. I wanted to be the voice for them, which is how my team adapted a model to customise art from photos.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While the venture has quite served as an intersection between art and technology, Rohaan reiterates how there&rsquo;s a charitable angle, which will always remain an integral part of all his ventures. &ldquo;A good 75 percent of our artists come from non-affluent backgrounds where they hold two jobs and paint over the weekends at home studios. The amount we pay them for the painting sometimes is their monthly wage.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s not all, this young entrepreneur&rsquo;s work has caught the fancy of celebs alike. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s heartening to see people encouraging new art,\" he states.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With a sound social media presence, this mechanical engineering graduate from PESIT tells us how starting early as an entrepreneur isn&rsquo;t easy, but doesn&rsquo;t come in the way of indulging his other interests. &ldquo;I love hitting the gym, playing golf and cooking. In fact, I make amazing Thai and Vietnamese food. Those and even travelling. In fact, every artist who&rsquo;s on board with us has been handpicked by our team during our team tours,&rdquo; shares Rohaan.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Albeit he has probably does not have a POA charted out for the immediate future, Rohaan is persistent on making it big and most importantly, making a difference in the art scene &ndash; in the city and world over. &ldquo;I wish to set up galleries at airports, so that the concept and the efforts of our artists get visibility. Where people who appreciate art can place orders on the go, while checking out the artwork in person,&rdquo; he signs off.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/canvas1476241175905.jpeg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baab806a12cf7ee39133b8","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"artists"},{"text":"hand paint photographs"},{"text":"canvas"},{"text":"handicrafts/arts"},{"text":"photos"},{"text":"art"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/books-and-art/091016/a-wide-canvas-to-promote-artists.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-12T02:59:49.339Z","udate":"2016-10-12T06:46:15.669Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-12T06:46:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fda72538939368e0c05afb","id":"57fda72538939368e0c05af9","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","tagsForSearch":"artists,hand paint photographs,canvas,handicrafts/arts,photos,art","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

{"_id":"57fdb86f385fc92f1e4ee270","title":"Ramayana","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fb6af76df6bbfd6adfc","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;\">The Ramayana belongs to a class of literature known in Sanskrit as <em>kavya</em> (poetry), though in the West it is considered to belong to the category of literature familiar to readers of Homer, namely the epic. It is one of two epics, the other being the Mahabharata, which have had a decisive influence in shaping the nature of Indian civilization. The Ramayana existed in the oral tradition perhaps as far back as 1,500 BCE, but the fourth century BCE is generally accepted as the date of its composition in Sanskrit by Valmiki. Though some right-wing ideologues in recent years, eager that the Ramayana should have the same kind of historicity attached to it as do the scriptures of Christianity and the <em>Koran</em>, have sought to date the Ramayana back to at least 6,000 years and even furnish an exact date for its composition, it by no means diminishes the importance of the text to suggest that the historicity of the Ramayana is the least interesting of the questions that can be raised about it and its characters. Whether in fact its hero Rama, who in Hindu mythology is an <u>avatar</u> of Vishnu but a principal deity in his own right, and who is also worshipped in parts of north India as a king, existed or not is scarcely of any importance. The other kind of excess is to view him merely as a trope &mdash; as a sign of patriarchy, for example, or as an insignia of valiant and militant kshatriyahood, which is what the present generation of Hindutvavadis have turned him into.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;\">The main frame of the story of the Ramayana is exceedingly well-known in India, imbibed by every Indian with, so to speak, mother&rsquo;s milk. The Koysala country, with Ayodhya as its capital, is presided over by Dasaratha. Though his eldest son Rama, son of his queen Kausalya, is entitled to the throne, and Dasaratha is himself keen that Rama should ascend to the kingship, Dasaratha&rsquo;s other queen Kaikeyi contrives to have Rama sent into exile for fourteen years, as well as have her own son, Bharatha, installed as king. Though Bharatha is not a party to the plot, and is devoted to his elder brother, Rama nonetheless proceeds to the forest, accompanied by his brother Lakshmana, who is one of two sons of Dasaratha&rsquo;s third queen, Sumithra, as well as by his wife, Sita, renowned for her beauty and matchless virtue. In the forest, Rama and his party have numerous adventures, but it is the abduction of Sita by <u>Ravana</u>, the demon-king of Lanka, which sets the stage for the epic battle between Rama and Ravana. In his efforts to find Sita, whose whereabouts are unknown, Rama is aided by Hanuman, the monkey god or god of wind. In Indian literature and mythology, there is no greater exemplar of the perfect devotee than Hanuman. Eventually, Ravana, his kin, and his entire force is defeated by Rama and his military allies, and in triumph Rama returns to Ayodhya with Lakshmana and Sita and is crowned king.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;\">It is important to recognize that there is not one Ramayana in India. Indeed, the original composition in Sanskrit by Valmiki is seldom read these days, and the most common Ramayanas are in the &lsquo;vernacular&rsquo; Indian languages. In south India, for instance, the Ramayana of Kamban, written in Tamil in the eleventh century, prevails; in north India, the Ramayana of Tulsidas, called the<em>Ramacaritmanas</em>, has become legendary. Even among the Hindus living in far-flung places of the Indian diaspora, such as Fiji and Trinidad, the Ramacaritmanas is the devotional text of Hinduism par excellence. There are Ramayanas in virtually all the major Indian languages, and a few dozen translations, mainly abridged, and \"transcreations\" in English. In the Bengali version of the story, Ravana is turned into the hero; and this narrative was again taken up by the nineteenth century Bengali writer, Michael Madhusudan Dutt (1824-73), whose own epic retelling of the Ramayana portrays Rama as a weak and effeminate figure representing an earlier stage of political naivete and parochialism. It is no surprise that one American scholar, Paula Richman, has written of the \"many Ramayanas\" in a book by the same title.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;\">Though the main story of the Ramayana may appear to be without much complexity, the epic presents numerous problems of interpretation, as has already been suggested. True, <u>Rama</u> appears in popular Indian representations (especially in the north) as the very model of the monogamous husband and just and good king; similarly, Sita has been seen as the supreme model of the virtuous, self-sacrificing, and obedient wife, the supreme embodiment of femininity as much as womanhood. But even a superficial reading of the Ramayana puts this interpretation at some risk. One problem is that the Ramayana appears in many versions, and the variant endings illustrate the nature of the diverse readings. In the commonly accepted version of the story, after Rama had rescued Sita and brought her back to Ayodhya, numerous rumors arose about the questionable fidelity of Sita that had the effect of unsettling Rama. Though Rama realized that his wife was the very paragon of virtue untainted, and that she would not have submitted to the sexual advances of Ravana, in whose captivity she had remained for many years, some doubts began to creep into his own mind; besides, as a king, it was his duty to put to rest the anxieties expressed by his subjects. Consequently, he subjected Sita to a public test: if she could emerge from the flames of the fire unscathed, that would be the touchstone of her unimpeachable moral character. Sita passes the test (<em>agnipariksha</em>) with flying colors, and henceforth takes her place besides Rama, and together they preside over Ayodhya. In a variant ending, Sita is sent to pass the rest of her life at the hermitage of Valmiki, where she gives birth to the twins Lava and Kusa; and eventually, pleading with the earth, from which she is descended, to be her witness, Sita [the word means \"furrow\"] returns to the earth from where she had come forth. This can be seen as a reprimand to Rama, as a reaffirmation of the feminine principle against the masculinity of realpolitik. One recent and moving reinterpretation of the Ramayana by Ramachandra Gandhi suggests that the portion about the <em>agnipariksha</em> is not part of the story as it appeared in the oral tradition, being added at the instance of patriarchal men who came to exercise increasing influence in Indian society.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;\">Even the character of Rama is not without its blemishes [see <u>Rama</u>]. Contrariwise, even Tulsidas&rsquo;s <em>Ramacaritmanas</em>, which is the most patriarchal of the widely read versions, recognizes that <u>Ravana</u> was not without certain admirable qualities. Indeed, the tales about the Ramayana suggest a wonderful self-reflexivity. When Rama agrees to go into exile, he attempts to dissuade Sita from following him; she is advised that as a princess, accustomed to all the luxuries that life has to offer, the hardships of a meager and hard existence in the forest are not for her. But, as a Hindu wife, Sita suggests that she will willingly share her husband&rsquo;s life, and that at this critical moment she cannot abandon him. The Indian writer Ananthamurthy has written about one version of the Ramayana, where Rama pleads with Sita to remain behind in Ayodhya; finally, exasperated by his presumption that women must not undergo the hardships of life, Sita says to Rama: \"If in all other Ramayanas I accompany you, how can I not do so in this Ramayana.\"</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>THE TEXT</strong>: The Valmiki or Sanskrit Ramayana contains nearly 50,000 lines of verse, and is much longer than both the Iliad and the Odyssey.

{"_id":"57fdb97ecf43e76842715e62","title":"Changing 'flavor' of humans could help in fight against malaria: Study","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e2e34a4ac2d218b1a46","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A new study by <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Johns-Hopkins\">Johns Hopkins</a>&nbsp;researchers suggests that a specialized area of the mosquito brain mixes tastes with smells to create unique and preferred flavors.<br /><br />The findings advance the possibility of identifying a substance that makes \"human flavor\" repulsive to the malaria-bearing species of the mosquitoes, so instead of feasting on us, they keep the disease to themselves, potentially saving an estimated 450,000 lives a year worldwide.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Malaria\">Malaria</a> is an infectious parasite disease of humans and animals transmitted by the bite of the female Anopheles gambiae mosquito. The experts estimate it affected 214 million people, mostly in Africa, last year despite decades of mosquito eradication and control efforts. There is no malaria vaccine and although the disease is curable in early stages, treatment is costly and difficult to deliver in places where it is endemic.<br /><br />Researcher <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Christopher-Potter\">Christopher Potter</a> said, \"All mosquitoes, including the one that transmits malaria, use their sense of smell to find a host for a blood meal. Our goal is to let the mosquitoes tell us what smells they find repulsive and use those to keep them from biting us.\"<br /><br />Because smell is essential to mosquito survival, each mosquito has three pairs of \"noses\" for sensing odors: two antennae, two maxillary palps and two labella. The maxillary palps are thick, fuzzy appendages that protrude from the lower region of the mosquito's head, more or less parallel to its proboscis, the long, flexible sheath that keeps its \"feeding needle\" under wraps until needed. At the very tip of the proboscis are the labella, two small regions that contain both \"gustatory\" neurons that pick up tastes and olfactory neurons for recognizing odorants.<br /><br />To better understand how Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes that cause malaria receive and process olfactory information from so many sensory regions, Potter's team wanted to see where olfactory neurons from those regions go to in the brain. They used a powerful genetic technique to make certain neurons \"glow\" green. The green glowing label was designed to appear specifically in neurons that receive complex odors through proteins called odorant receptors (ORs), since OR neurons are known to help distinguish humans from other warm-blooded animals in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which carry the Zika virus.<br /><br />Lead author of the study Olena Riabinina said \"This is the first time researchers managed to specifically target sensory neurons in mosquitoes. Previously, we had to use flies as a proxy for all insects, but now we can directly study the sense of smell in the insects that spread malaria.\"<br /><br />\"We were pleasantly surprised by how well our genetic technique worked and how easy it is now to see the smell-detecting neurons. The ease of identification will definitely simplify our task of studying these neurons in the future,\" she added.<br /><br />Potter said the OR neurons from the antennae and maxillary palps went to symmetrical areas of the brain called antennal lobes, just as they do in flies. But he seemed surprised to see that the OR neurons from the labella went to the so-called subesophageal zone, which, had never been associated with the sense of smell in any fly or insect; it had only been associated with the sense of taste.<br /><br />\"That finding suggests that perhaps mosquitoes don't just like our smell, but also our flavor,\" said Potter. Adding, \"It's likely that the odorants coming off our skin are picked up by the labella and influence the preferred taste of our skin, especially when the mosquito is looking for a place to bite.\" The finding potentially offers researchers one more way to repel mosquitoes.<br /><br />The antennae and maxillary palps are more specialized for picking up long-range signals, while the labella come into direct contact with our skin. In fact, before injecting their needlelike proboscis, mosquitoes use the labella to probe about on a victim's skin.<br /><br />\"We don't really know why they do that, but we suspect that they're looking for sensory cues that hint at easy access to a blood vessel. This suggests that a combination of repellants could keep mosquitoes from biting us in two ways. One could target the antennal neurons and reduce the likelihood that they come too close, while another could target the labellar neurons and make the mosquitoes turn away in disgust -- before sucking our blood -- if they got close enough to land on us,\" he said.<br /><br />The two-part genetic system devised to generate the glowing neurons will make it much easier to mix and match genetically altered mosquitoes to generate new traits. His group has already created a strain of An. gambiae mosquitoes whose OR neurons glow green upon activation. Scientists can thus see which neurons light up in response to a specific smell.<br /><br />\"Using this method, we hope to find an odorant that is safe and pleasant-smelling for us but strongly repellant to mosquitoes at very low concentrations,\" said Potter.<br /><br />His group compared the brains of male and female mosquitoes. Since only females use their sense of smell to find humans and males feed only on nectar, it was previously thought that males had just a rudimentary sense of smell.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Potter group found instead that males have the same level of complexity in their brains to detect odors as females but have fewer olfactory neurons. \"It appears that males might just have a scaled-down version of a female's sense of smell. So they can still smell everything a female smells, just not as well,\" he said.</p>\n<div class=\"last7brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">His group plans to study other types of neurons to better understand how signals from the mosquitoes' three types of olfactory receptors interact to influence their behavior. For instance, why is lactic acid not attractive on its own but highly attractive when mixed with carbon dioxide?</div>\n<div class=\"last7brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"last7brdiv\">\"We'd like to figure out what regions and neurons in the brain lead to this combined effect. If we can identify them, perhaps we could also stop them from working,\" Potter said.\n<div class=\"last3brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"last2brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The study was published in Nature Communications journal.</div>\n</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/chikangunya1476245875371.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf24aea63af2cd0d81ce6","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"johns hopkins"},{"text":"mosquito"},{"text":"malaria"},{"text":"disease"},{"text":"anopheles gambiae mosquito"},{"text":"christopher potter"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/Changing-flavor-of-humans-could-help-in-fight-against-malaria-Study/articleshow/54776908.cms","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-12T04:18:06.563Z","udate":"2016-10-12T06:33:35.769Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-12T06:33:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fdb97ecf43e76842715e64","id":"57fdb97ecf43e76842715e62","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out7213.mp3","tagsForSearch":"johns hopkins,mosquito,malaria,disease,anopheles gambiae mosquito,christopher potter","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

{"_id":"57fdbcb6385fc92f1e4ee294","title":"The 101 most important painters of the history of western painting, from 13th century to 21st century","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p>Although this list stems from a deep study of the painters, their contribution to Western painting, and their influence on later artists; we are aware that objectivity does not exist in Art, so we understand that most readers will not agree 100% with this list. In any case, theartwolf.com assures that this list is only intended as a tribute to painting and the painters who have made it an unforgettable Art</p>\n<p>1. <strong>PABLO PICASSO</strong> (1881-1973) &ndash; Picasso is to Art History a giant earthquake with eternal aftermaths. With the possible exception of Michelangelo (who focused his greatest efforts in sculpture and architecture), no other artist had such ambitions at the time of placing his oeuvre in the history of art. Picasso created the avant-garde. Picasso destroyed the avant-garde. He looked back at the masters and surpassed them all. He faced the whole history of art and single-handedly redefined the tortuous relationship between work and spectator</p>\n<p>2. <strong>GIOTTO DI BONDONE</strong> (c.1267-1337) &ndash; It has been said that Giotto was the first real painter, like Adam was the first man. We agree with the first part. Giotto continued the Byzantine style of Cimabue and other predecessors, but he earned the right to be included in gold letters in the history of painting when he added a quality unknown to date: emotion</p>\n<p>3. <strong>LEONARDO DA VINCI</strong> (1452-1519) &ndash; For better or for worse, Leonardo will be forever known as the author of the most famous painting of all time, the \"Gioconda\" or \"Mona Lisa\". But he is more, much more. His humanist, almost scientific gaze, entered the art of the quattrocento and revoluted it with his sfumetto that nobody was ever able to imitate</p>\n<p>4. <strong>PAUL C&Eacute;ZANNE</strong> (1839-1906) &ndash; <em>\"Cezanne is the father of us all.\"</em> This famous quote has been attributed to both Picasso and Matisse, and certainly it does not matter who actually said it, because in either case would be appropriate. While he exhibited with the Impressionist painters, C&eacute;zanne left behind the whole group and developed a style of painting never seen so far, which opened the door for the arrival of Cubism and the rest of the vanguards of the twentieth century</p>\n<p>5. <strong>REMBRANDT VAN RIJN</strong> (1606-1669) &ndash; The fascinating use of the light and shadows in Rembrandt's works seem to reflect his own life, moving from fame to oblivion. Rembrandt is the great master of Dutch painting, and, along with Vel&aacute;zquez, the main figure of 17th century European Painting. He is, in addition, the great master of the self-portrait of all time, an artist who had never show mercy at the time of depicting himself</p>\n<p>6. <strong>DIEGO VEL&Aacute;ZQUEZ</strong> (1599-1660) &ndash; Along with Rembrandt, one of the summits of Baroque painting. But unlike the Dutch artist, the Sevillan painter spent most of his life in the comfortable but rigid courtesan society. Nevertheless, Vel&aacute;zquez was an innovator, a \"painter of atmospheres\" two centuries before Turner and the Impressionists, which it is shown in his colossal 'royal paintings' (\"Meninas\", \"The Forge of Vulcan\"), but also in his small and memorable sketches of the Villa Medici.</p>\n<p>7. <strong>WASSILY KANDINSKY</strong> (1866-1944) &ndash; Although the title of \"father of abstraction\" has been assigned to several artists, from Picasso to Turner, few painters could claim it with as much justice as Kandinsky. Many artists have succeeded in painting emotion, but very few have changed the way we understand art. Wassily Kandinsky is one of them.</p>\n<p>8. <strong>CLAUDE MONET</strong> (1840-1926) &ndash; The importance of Monet in the history of art is sometimes \"underrated\", as Art lovers tend to see only the overwhelming beauty that emanates from his canvases, ignoring the complex technique and composition of the work (a \"defect\" somehow caused by Monet himself, when he declared that <em>\"I do not understand why everyone discusses my art and pretends to understand, as if it were necessary to understand, when it is simply necessary to love\"</em>). However, Monet's experiments, including studies on the changes in an object caused by daylight at different times of the day; and the almost abstract quality of his \"water lilies\", are clearly a prologue to the art of the twentieth century.</p>\n<p>9. <strong>CARAVAGGIO</strong> (1571-1610) &ndash; The tough and violent Caravaggio is considered the father of Baroque painting, with his spectacular use of lights and shadows. Caravaggio&rsquo;s chiaroscuro became so famous that many painters started to copy his paintings, creating the 'Caravaggisti' style.</p>\n<p>10. <strong>JOSEPH MALLORD WILLIAM TURNER</strong> (1775-1851) &ndash; Turner is the best landscape painter of Western painting. Whereas he had been at his beginnings an academic painter, Turner was slowly but unstoppably evolving towards a free, atmospheric style, sometimes even outlining the abstraction, which was misunderstood and rejected by the same critics who had admired him for decades</p>\n<p>11.<strong> JAN VAN EYCK</strong> (1390-1441) &ndash; Van Eyck is the colossal pillar on which rests the whole Flemish paintings from later centuries, the genius of accuracy, thoroughness and perspective, well above any other artist of his time, either Flemish or Italian.</p>\n<p>12. <strong>ALBRECHT D&Uuml;RER</strong> (1471-1528) &ndash; The real Leonardo da Vinci of Northern European Rennaisance was Albrecht D&uuml;rer, a restless and innovative genious, master of drawing and color. He is one of the first artists to represent nature without artifice, either in his painted landscapes or in his drawings of plants and animals</p>\n<p>13. <strong>JACKSON POLLOCK</strong> (1912-1956) &ndash; The major figure of American Abstract Expressionism, Pollock created his best works, his famous drips, between 1947 and 1950. After those fascinating years, comparable to Picasso&rsquo;s blue period or van Gogh&rsquo;s final months in Auvers, he abandoned the drip, and his latest works are often bold, unexciting works.</p>\n<p>14. <strong>MICHELANGELO BUONARROTI</strong> (1475-1564) &ndash; Some readers will be quite surprised to see the man who is, along with Picasso, the greatest artistic genius of all time, out of the \"top ten\" of this list, but the fact is that even Michelangelo defined himself as \"sculptor\", and even his painted masterpiece (the frescoes in the Sistine Chapel) are often defined as 'painted sculptures'. Nevertheless, that unforgettable masterpiece is enough to guarantee him a place of honor in the history of painting</p>\n<p>15. <strong>PAUL GAUGUIN</strong> (1848-1903) &ndash; One of the most fascinating figures in the history of painting, his works moved from Impressionism (soon abandoned) to a colorful and vigorous symbolism, as can be seen in his 'Polynesian paintings'. Matisse and Fauvism could not be understood without the works of Paul Gauguin</p>\n<p>16. <strong>FRANCISCO DE GOYA</strong> (1746-1828) - Goya is an enigma. In the whole History of Art few figures are as complex as the artist born in Fuendetodos, Spain. Enterprising and indefinable, a painter with no rival in all his life, Goya was the painter of the Court and the painter of the people. He was a religious painter and a mystical painter. He was the author of the beauty and eroticism of the 'Maja desnuda' and the creator of the explicit horror of 'The Third of May, 1808'. He was an oil painter, a fresco painter, a sketcher and an engraver. And he never stopped his metamorphosis</p>\n<p>17. <strong>VINCENT VAN GOGH</strong> (1853-1890) &ndash; Few names in the history of painting are now as famous as Van Gogh, despite the complete neglect he suffered in life. His works, strong and personal, are one of the greatest influences in the twentieth century painting, especially in German Expressionism</p>\n<p>18. <strong>&Eacute;DOUARD MANET</strong> (1832-1883) &ndash; Manet was the origin of Impressionism, a revolutionary in a time of great artistic revolutions. His (at the time) quite polemical \"Olympia\" or \"D&eacute;jeuner sur l'Herbe\" opened the way for the great figures of Impressionism</p>\n<p>19. <strong>MARK ROTHKO</strong> (1903-1970) &ndash; The influence of Rothko in the history of painting is yet to be quantified, because the truth is that almost 40 years after his death the influence of Rothko's large, dazzling and emotional masses of color continues to increase in many painters of the 21st century</p>\n<p>20. <strong>HENRI MATISSE </strong>(1869-1954) &ndash; Art critics tend to regard Matisse as the greatest exponent of twentieth century painting, only surpassed by Picasso. This is an exaggeration, although the almost pure use of color in some of his works strongly influenced many of the following avant-gardes</p>\n<p>21. <strong>RAPHAEL</strong> (1483-1520) &ndash; Equally loved and hated in different eras, no one can doubt that Raphael is one of the greatest geniuses of the Renaissance, with an excellent technique in terms of drawing and color</p>\n<p>22. <strong>JEAN-MICHEL BASQUIAT</strong> (1960-1988) - Basquiat is undoubtedly the most important and famous member of the \"graffiti movement\" that appeared in the New York scene in the early'80s, an artistic movement whose enormous influence on later painting is still to be measured</p>\n<p>23. <strong>EDVARD MUNCH</strong> (1863-1944) &ndash; Modernist in his context, Munch could be also considered the first expressionist painter in history. Works like \"The Scream\" are vital to understanding the twentieth century painting.</p>\n<p>24. <strong>TITIAN</strong> (c.1476-1576) &ndash; After the premature death of Giorgione, Titian became the leading figure of Venetian painting of his time. His use of color and his taste for mythological themes defined the main features of 16th century Venetian Art. His influence on later artists -Rubens, Vel&aacute;zquez...- is extremely important</p>\n<p>25. <strong>PIET MONDRIAN</strong> (1872 -1944) &ndash; Along with Kandinsky and Malevich, Mondrian is the leading figure of early abstract painting. After emigrating to New York, Mondrian filled his abstract paintings with a fascinating emotional quality, as we can se in his series of <em><a href=\"http://www.theartwolf.com/masterworks/mondrian.htm\" target=\"_blank\">\"boogie-woogies\"</a></em> created in the mid-40s</p>\n<p>26. <strong>PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA</strong> (1416-1492) - Despite being one of the most important figures of the quattrocento, the Art of Piero della Francesca has been described as &ldquo;cold&rdquo;, &ldquo;hieratic&rdquo; or even &ldquo;impersonal&rdquo;. But with the apparition of Berenson and the great historians of his era, like Michel H&eacute;rubel -who defended the &ldquo;metaphysical dimension&rdquo; of the paintings by Piero-, his precise and detailed Art finally occupied the place that it deserves in the Art history</p>\n<p>27. <strong>PETER PAUL RUBENS</strong> (1577-1640) &ndash; Rubens was one of the most prolific painters of all time, thanks in part to the collaboration of his study. Very famous in life, he traveled around Europe to meet orders from very wealthy and important clients. His female nudes are still amazing in our days</p>\n<p>28. <strong>ANDY WARHOL</strong> (1928-1987) &ndash; Brilliant and controversial, Warhol is the leading figure of pop-art and one of the icons of contemporary art. His silkscreen series depicting icons of the mass-media (as a reinterpretation of Monet's series of Water lilies or the Rouen Cathedral) are one of the milestones of contemporary Art, with a huge influence in the Art of our days</p>\n<p>29. <strong>JOAN MIR&Oacute;</strong> (1893-1983) &ndash; Like most geniuses, Miro is an unclassificable artist. His interest in the world of the unconscious, those hidden in the depths of the mind, link him with Surrealism, but with a personal style, sometimes closer to Fauvism and Expressionism. His most important works are those from the series of \"Constellations\", created in the early 40s</p>\n<p>30. <strong>TOMMASO MASACCIO</strong> (1401-1428) &ndash; Masaccio was one of the first old masters to use the laws of scientific perspective in his works . One of the greatest innovative painters of the Early Renaissance</p>\n<p>31. <strong>MARC CHAGALL</strong> (1887-1985) &ndash; Artist of dreams and fantasies, Chagall was for all his life an immigrant fascinated by the lights and colors of the places he visited. Few names from the School of Paris of the early twentieth century have contributed so much -and with such variety of ideas- to change modern Art as this man \"impressed by the light,\" as he defined himself</p>\n<p>31. <strong>GUSTAVE COURBET</strong> (1819-1877) &ndash; Leading figure of realism, and a clear precedent for the impressionists, Courbet was one of the greatest revolutionaries, both as an artist and as a social-activist, of the history of painting. Like Rembrandt and other predecessors, Courbet did not seek to create beauty, but believed that beauty is achieved when and artist represents the purest reality without artifice</p>\n<p>33. <strong>NICOLAS POUSSIN</strong> (1594-1665) &ndash; The greatest among the great French Baroque painters, Poussin had a vital influence on French painting for many centuries. His use of color is unique among all the painters of his era</p>\n<p>34. <strong>WILLEM DE KOONING </strong>(1904-1997) &ndash; After Pollock, the leading figure of abstract expressionism, though one of his greatest contributions was not to feel limited by the abstraction, often resorting to a heartbreaking figurative painting (his series of \"Women\" are the best example) with a major influence on later artists such as Francis Bacon or Lucian Freud</p>\n<p>35. <strong>PAUL KLEE</strong> (1879-1940) &ndash; In a period of artistic revolutions and innovations, few artists were as crucial as Paul Klee. His studies of color, widely taught at the Bauhaus, are unique among all the artists of his time</p>\n<p>36. <strong>FRANCIS BACON</strong> (1909-1992) - Maximum exponent, along with Lucian Freud, of the so-called \"School of London\", Bacon's style was totally against all canons of painting, not only in those terms related to beauty, but also against the dominance of the Abstract Expressionism of his time</p>\n<p>37. <strong>GUSTAV KLIMT </strong>(1862-1918) &ndash; Half way between modernism and symbolism appears the figure of Gustav Klimt, who was also devoted to the industrial arts. His nearly abstract landscapes also make him a forerunner of geometric abstraction</p>\n<p>38. <strong>EUG&Egrave;NE DELACROIX</strong> (1798-1863) &ndash; Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix is the French romanticism painter <em>\"par excellence\"</em> and one of the most important names in the European painting of the first half of the 19th century. His famous <em>&ldquo;Liberty leading the People&rdquo;</em> also demonstrates the capacity of Painting to become the symbol of an era.</p>\n<p>39. <strong>PAOLO UCCELLO</strong> (1397-1475) &ndash; &ldquo;Solitary, eccentric, melancholic and poor&rdquo;. Giorgio Vasari described with these four words one of the most audacious geniuses of the early Florentine Renaissance, Paolo Uccello.</p>\n<p>40. <strong>WILLIAM BLAKE</strong> (1757-1827) &ndash; Revolutionary and mystic, painter and poet, Blake is one of the most fascinating artists of any era. His watercolors, prints and temperas are filled with a wild imagination (almost crazyness), unique among the artists of his era</p>\n<p>41. <strong>KAZIMIR MALEVICH </strong>(1878-1935) &ndash; Creator of Suprematism, Malevich will forever be one of the most controversial figures of the history of art among the general public, divided between those who consider him an essential renewal and those who consider that his works based on polygons of pure colors do not deserve to be considered Art</p>\n<p>42. <strong>ANDREA MANTEGNA</strong> (1431-1506) &ndash; One of the greatest exponents of the Quattrocento, interested in the human figure, which he often represented under extreme perspectives (<em>\"The Dead Christ\"</em>)</p>\n<p>43. <strong>JAN VERMEER</strong> (1632-1675) &ndash; Vermeer was the leading figure of the Delft School, and for sure one of the greatest landscape painters of all time. Works such as <em>\"View of the Delft\"</em> are considered almost \"impressionist\" due to the liveliness of his brushwork. He was also a skilled portraitist</p>\n<p>44. <strong>EL GRECO</strong> (1541-1614) &ndash; One of the most original and fascinating artists of his era, with a very personal technique that was admired, three centuries later, by the impressionist painters</p>\n<p>45. <strong>CASPAR DAVID FRIEDRICH</strong> (1774-1840) &ndash; Leading figure of German Romantic painting, Friedrich is still identified as the painter of landscapes of loneliness and distress, with human figures facing the terrible magnificence of nature.</p>\n<p>46. <strong>WINSLOW HOMER</strong> (1836-1910) &ndash; The main figure of American painting of his era, Homer was a breath of fresh air for the American artistic scene, which was \"stuck\" in academic painting and the more romantic Hudson River School. Homer's loose and lively brushstroke is almost impressionistic .</p>\n<p>47. <strong>MARCEL DUCHAMP</strong> (1887-1968) &ndash; One of the major figures of Dadaism and a prototype of \"total artist\", Duchamp is one of the most important and controversial figures of his era. His contribution to painting is just a small part of his huge contribution to the art world.</p>\n<p>48. <strong>GIORGIONE</strong> (1478-1510) - Like so many other painters who died at young age, Giorgione (1477-1510) makes us wonder what place would his exquisite painting occupy in the history of Art if he had enjoyed a long existence, just like his direct artistic heir - Titian.</p>\n<p>49. <strong>FRIDA KAHLO</strong> (1907-1954) &ndash; In recent years, Frida's increasing fame seems to have obscured her importance in Latin American art. On September 17th, 1925, Kahlo was almost killed in a terrible bus accident. She did not died, but the violent crash had terrible sequels, breaking her spinal column, pelvis, and right leg.. After this accident, Kahlo's self-portraits can be considered as quiet but terrible moans</p>\n<p>50. <strong>HANS HOLBEIN THE YOUNGER</strong> (1497-1543) &ndash; After D&uuml;rer, Holbein is the greatest of the German painters of his time. The fascinating portrait of <em>\"The Ambassadors\" </em>is still considered one of the most enigmatic paintings of art history</p>\n<p>51.<strong> EDGAR DEGAS</strong> (1834-1917) &ndash; Though Degas was not a \"pure\" impressionist painter, his works shared the ideals of that artistic movement. Degas paintings of young dancers or<em>ballerinas</em> are icons of late 19th century painting</p>\n<p>52. <strong>FRA ANGELICO</strong> (1387-1455) &ndash; One of the great colorists from the early Renaissance. Initially trained as an illuminator, he is the author of masterpieces such as \"<em>The Annunciatio</em>n\" in the Prado Museum.</p>\n<p>53. <strong>GEORGES SEURAT </strong>(1859-1891) - Georges Seurat is one of the most important post-impressionist painters, and he is considered the creator of the \"pointillism\", a style of painting in which small distinct points of primary colors create the impression of a wide selection of secondary and intermediate colors.</p>\n<p>54. <strong>JEAN-ANTOINE WATTEAU</strong> (1684-1721) &ndash; Watteau is today considered one of the pioneers of rococo. Unfortunately, he died at the height of his powers, as it is evidenced in the great portrait of \"<em>Gilles</em>\" painted in the year of his death</p>\n<p>55. <strong>SALVADOR DAL&Iacute;</strong> (1904-1989) &ndash; \"I am Surrealism!\" shouted Dal&iacute; when he was expelled from the surrealist movement by Andr&eacute; Breton. Although the quote sounds presumptuous (which was not unusual in Dal&iacute;), the fact is that Dal&iacute;'s paintings are now the most famous images of all the surrealist movement.</p>\n<p>56. <strong>MAX ERNST </strong>(1891-1976) &ndash; Halfway between Surrealism and Dadaism appears Max Ernst, important in both movements. Ernst was a brave artistic explorer thanks in part to the support of his wife and patron, Peggy Guggenheim</p>\n<p>57. <strong>TINTORETTO</strong> (1518-1594) - Tintoretto is the most flamboyant of all Venetian masters (not the best, such honour can only be reclaimed by Titian or Giorgione) and his remarkable oeuvre not only closed the Venetian splendour till the apparition of Canaletto and his contemporaries, but also makes him the last of the Cinquecento masters.</p>\n<p>58.<strong> JASPER JOHNS</strong> (born 1930) &ndash; The last living legend of the early Pop Art, although he has never considered himself a \"pop artist\". His most famous works are the series of \"<em>Flags</em>\" and \"<em>Targets</em>\".</p>\n<p>59. <strong>SANDRO BOTTICELLI</strong> (1445-1510) &ndash; \"If Botticelli were alive now he would be working for Vogue\", said actor Peter Ustinov. As well as Raphael, Botticelli had been equally loved or hated in different eras, but his use of color is one of the most fascinating among all old masters.</p>\n<p>60. <strong>DAVID HOCKNEY</strong> (born 1937) - David Hockney is one of the living myths of the Pop Art. Born in Great Britain, he moved to California, where he immediately felt identified with the light, the culture and the urban landscape of the 'Golden State'</p>\n<p>61. <strong>UMBERTO BOCCIONI</strong> (1882-1916) &ndash; The maximum figure of Italian Futurism, fascinated by the world of the machine, and the movement as a symbol of contemporary times.</p>\n<p>62. <strong>JOACHIM PATINIR</strong> (1480-1524) &ndash; Much less technically gifted than other Flemish painters like Memling or van der Weyden, his contribution to the history of art is vital for the incorporation of landscape as a major element in the painting.</p>\n<p>63. <strong>DUCCIO DA BUONINSEGNA</strong> (c.1255/60 &ndash; 1318/19) &ndash; While in Florence Giotto di Bondone was changing the history of painting, Duccio of Buoninsegna provided a breath of fresh air to the important Sienese School.</p>\n<p>64. <strong>ROGER VAN DER WEYDEN</strong> (1399-1464) &ndash; After Van Eyck, the leading exponent of Flemish painting in the fifteenth century; a master of perspective and composition.</p>\n<p>65. <strong>JOHN CONSTABLE</strong> (1776-1837) &ndash; John Constable (1776-1837) is, along with Turner, the great figure of English romanticism. But unlike his contemporary, he never left England, and he devoted all his time to represent the life and landscapes of his beloved England.</p>\n<p>66. <strong>JACQUES-LOUIS DAVID</strong> (1748-1825) &ndash; David is the summit of neoclassicism, a grandiloquent artist whose compositions seem to reflect his own hectic and revolutionary life.</p>\n<p>67. <strong>ARSHILLE GORKY</strong> (1905-1948) &ndash; Armenian-born American painter, Gorky was a surrealist painter and also one of the leaders of abstract expressionism. He was called \"the Ingres of the unconscious\".</p>\n<p>68. <strong>HIERONYMUS BOSCH </strong>(1450-1516) &ndash; An extremely religious man, all works by Bosch are basically moralizing, didactic. The artist sees in the society of his time the triumph of sin, the depravation, and all the things that have caused the fall of the human being from its angelical character; and he wants to warn his contemporaries about the terrible consequences of his impure acts.</p>\n<p>69. <strong>PIETER BRUEGEL THE ELDER</strong> (1528-1569) - Many scholars and art critics claim to have found important similarities between the works by Hyeronimus Bosch and those by Brueghel, but the truth is that the differences between both of them are abysmal. Whereas Bosch's fantasies are born of a deep deception and preoccupation for the human being, with a clearly moralizing message; works by Bruegel are full of irony, and even filled with a love for the rural life, which seems to anticipate the Dutch landscape paintings from the next century.</p>\n<p>70. <strong>SIMONE MARTINI</strong> (1284-1344) &ndash; One of the great painters of the <em>Trecento</em>, he was a step further and helped to expand its progress, which culminated in the \"International Style\".</p>\n<p>71. <strong>Frederic Edwin Church</strong> (1826-1900) - Church represents the culmination of the Hudson River School: he had Cole's love for the landscape, Asher Brown Durand's romantic lyricism, and Albert Bierstadt's grandiloquence, but he was braver and technically more gifted than anyone of them. Church is without any doubt one of the greatest landscape painters of all time, perhaps only surpassed by Turner and some impressionists and postimpressionists like Monet or C&eacute;zanne.</p>\n<p>72. <strong>EDWARD HOPPER</strong> (1882-1967) &ndash; Hopper is widely known as the painter of urban loneliness. His most famous work, the fabulous \"Nighthawks\" (1942) has become the symbol of the solitude of the contemporary metropolis, and it is one of the icons of the 20th century Art.</p>\n<p>73. <strong>LUCIO FONTANA</strong> (1899-1968) &ndash; Father of the \"White Manifesto\", in which he stated that <em>\"Matter, colour and sound in motion are the phenomena whose simultaneous development makes up the new art\"</em>. His &ldquo;<em>Concepts Spatiales</em>&rdquo; are already icons of the art of the second half of the twentieth century.</p>\n<p>74. <strong>FRANZ MARC</strong> (1880-1916) &ndash; After Kandinsky, the great figure of the Expressionist group \"The Blue Rider\" and one of the most important expressionist painters ever. He died at the height of his artistic powers, when his use of color was even anticipating the later abstraction.</p>\n<p>75. <strong>PIERRE-AUGUSTE RENOIR</strong> (1841-1919) &ndash; One of the key figures of Impressionism, he soon left the movement to pursue a more personal, academic painting.</p>\n<p>76. <strong>JAMES MCNEILL WHISTLER</strong> (1856-1921) &ndash; Along with Winslow Homer, the great figure of American painting of his time. Whistler was an excellent portraitist, which is shown in the fabulous portrait of his mother, considered one of the great masterpieces of American painting of all time.</p>\n<p>77. <strong>THEODORE G&Eacute;RICAULT</strong> (1791-1824) &ndash; Key figure in romanticism, revolutionary in his life and works despite his bourgeois origins. In his masterpiece, <em>\"The raft of the Medusa\"</em>, Gericault creates a painting that we can define as \"politically incorrect\", as it depicts the miseries of a large group of castaways abandoned after the shipwreck of a French naval frigate.</p>\n<p>78. <strong>WILLIAM HOGARTH</strong> (1697-1764) &ndash; A list of the great portrait painters of all time should never miss the name of William Hogarth, whose studies and sketches could even qualify as \"pre-impressionist\".</p>\n<p>79. <strong>CAMILLE COROT</strong> (1796-1875) &ndash; One of the great figures of French realism in the 19th century and certainly one of the major influences for the impressionist painters like Monet or Renoir, thanks to his love for \"plen-air\" painting, emphasizing the use of light.</p>\n<p>80. <strong>GEORGES BRAQUE</strong> (1882-1963) &ndash; Along with Picasso and Juan Gris, the main figure of Cubism, the most important of the avant-gardes of the 20th century Art.</p>\n<p>81. <strong>HANS MEMLING</strong> (1435-1494) &ndash; Perhaps the most complete and \"well-balanced\" of all fifteenth century Flemish painters, although he was not as innovative as Van Eyck or van der Weyden.</p>\n<p>82. <strong>GERHARD RICHTER</strong> (born 1932) &ndash; One of the most important artists of recent decades, Richter is known either for his fierce and colorful abstractions or his serene landscapes and scenes with candles.</p>\n<p>83. <strong>AMEDEO MODIGLIANI</strong> (1884-1920) &ndash; One of the most original portraitists of the history of painting, considered as a \"cursed\" painter because of his wild life and early death.</p>\n<p>84. <strong>GEORGES DE LA TOUR</strong> (1593-1652) &ndash; The influence of Caravaggio is evident in De la Tour, whose use of light and shadows is unique among the painters of the Baroque era.</p>\n<p>85. <strong>GENTILESCHI, ARTEMISIA</strong> (1597-1654) &ndash; One of the most gifted artists of the early baroque era, she was the first female painter to become a member of the <em>Accademia di Arte del Disegno</em> in Florence.</p>\n<p>86. <strong>JEAN FRAN&Ccedil;OIS MILLET</strong> (1814-1875) &ndash; One of the main figures of the Barbizon School, author of one of the most emotive paintings of the 19th century: The \"<em>Angelus</em>\".</p>\n<p>87. <strong>FRANCISCO DE ZURBAR&Aacute;N</strong> (1598-1664) &ndash; The closest to Caravaggio of all Spanish Baroque painters, his latest works show a mastery of chiaroscuro without parallel among any other painter of his time.</p>\n<p>88. <strong>CIMABUE</strong> (c.1240-1302) &ndash; Although in some of his works Cimabue already represented a visible evolution of the rigid Byzantine art, his greatest contribution to painting was to discover a young talented artist named Giotto (see number 2), who changed forever the Western painting.</p>\n<p>89. <strong>JAMES ENSOR</strong> (1860-1949) &ndash; Violent painter whose strong, almost \"unfinished\" works make him a precursor of Expressionism</p>\n<p>90.<strong> REN&Eacute; MAGRITTE </strong>(1898-1967) &ndash; One of the leading figures of surrealism, his apparently simple works are the result of a complex reflection about reality and the world of dreams</p>\n<p>91. <strong>EL LISSITZKY</strong> (1890-1941) &ndash; One of the main exponents of Russian avant-garde painting. Influenced by Malevich, he also excelled in graphic design.</p>\n<p>92. <strong>EGON SCHIELE</strong> (1890-1918) &ndash; Another \"died too young\" artist, his strong and ruthless portraits influenced the works of later artists, like Lucian freud or Francis Bacon.</p>\n<p>93. <strong>DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</strong> (1828-1882) &ndash; Perhaps the key figure in the pre-Raphaelite movement, Rossetti left the poetry to focus on classic painting with a style that influenced the symbolism.</p>\n<p>94. <strong>FRANS HALS</strong> (c.1580-1666) &ndash; One of the most important portraitists ever, his lively brushwork influenced early impressionism.</p>\n<p>95. <strong>CLAUDE LORRAIN</strong> (1600-1682) &ndash; His works were a vital influence on many landscape painters for many centuries, both in Europe (Corot, Courbet) and in America (Hudson River School).</p>\n<p>96. <strong>ROY LICHTENSTEIN</strong> (1923-1977) &ndash; Along with Andy Warhol, the most famous figure of the American Pop-Art. His works are often related to the style of the comics, though Lichtenstein rejected that idea.</p>\n<p>97. <strong>GEORGIA O'KEEFE</strong> (1887-1986) &ndash; A leading figure in the 20th century American Art, O'Keefe single-handedly redefined the Western American painting.</p>\n<p>98. <strong>GUSTAVE MOREAU</strong> (1826-1898) &ndash; One of the key figures of symbolism, introverted and mysterious in life, but very free and colorful in his works.</p>\n<p>99. <strong>GIORGIO DE CHIRICO</strong> (1888-1978) &ndash; Considered the father of metaphysical painting and a major influence on the Surrealist movement.</p>\n<p>100. <strong>FERNAND L&Eacute;GER</strong> (1881-1955) &ndash; At first a cubist, Leger was increasingly attracted to the world of machinery and movement, creating works such as \"The Discs\" (1918).</p>\n<p>101. <strong>JEAN-AUGUSTE-DOMINIQUE INGRES</strong> (1780-1867) &ndash; Ingres was the most prominent disciple of the most famous neoclassicist painter, Jacques Louis David, so he should not be considered an innovator. He was, however, a master of classic portrait.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/Self-Portrait_Leonardo_da_Vinci1476246702266.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"picasso"},{"text":"da vinci"},{"text":"best"},{"text":"painters"},{"text":"101"},{"text":"wesern painting"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57fb6fc4e66f216b816f52ca","status":"Published","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-12T04:31:50.988Z","udate":"2016-10-13T07:06:16.308Z","expirydate":"2017-10-12T04:31:00.000Z","publiseherSectionId":"57f4eba09d620a1ad4af01ca","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fdbcb6385fc92f1e4ee296","publishedOn":"2016-10-12T06:46:00.000Z","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"sourceUrl":"http://www.theartwolf.com/articles/most-important-painters.htm","id":"57fdbcb6385fc92f1e4ee294","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out9304.mp3","tagsForSearch":"picasso,da vinci,best,painters,101,wesern painting","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

But the 'Nos' of the ketogenic diet (KD) make you wonder if this is whatJ K Rowling's Dementorss Dementors eat &mdash; no sugar, no bread, no rice, ?no fruit, no dal, no onions... all high-carb stuff that defines comfort food. What you get to eat instead is fat.<br /><br />Eating fat to cut the fat? If that seems illogical, it seems to work. Shriyam Bhagnani, 23, came down from 95 kg to 75kg in nine months by following the keto diet. \"I limit my carb intake to just salads. At home I cook my own food according to the diet guidelines. When I am travelling I usually eat omelettes and kebabs, and carry protein shake powder,\" says Bhagnani, a social media consultant in Mumbai. She pairs the diet with weight training as it enhances the outcomes.<br /><br />Normally, we meet 45-65% of our calorie requirement from carbs; keto cuts it to just 5-10%. You are not allowed to consume more than 20gm of carbs a day but eat more fat &mdash; 70% of calorie requirement. The diet trains the body to derive energy from fats instead of carbohydrates. Glucose from carbs has been linked to obesity, diabetes and cardiac diseases. But when fats are metabolized they create ketone bodies or ketones, which can be used as fuel, just like glucose, by human cells. The name 'ketogenic' comes from ketones.<br /><br />Standup comic Tanmay Bhat weighed 250kg in February 2015. With some basic workout and controlled eating he got the scale down to 150kg, and in January this year he started on the keto diet and vigorous weight training. \"Now he is down to 120kg and aiming to knock off another 20kg,\" says his coach, Ranveer Allahbadia, who shares videos of keto recipes on his <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/YouTube\">YouTube</a> channel, Beerbiceps.<br /><br />Most trainers say it works best with a daily workout but Priya Dogra Aurora, 39, is relying purely on keto without having stepped inside a gym. \"I have been on keto since January last year. At the time I used to weigh 100kg and now I am 62kg,\" says Aurora, who lives and works in Shimla. She researched the diet online and created recipes that can be made using local ingredients. \"Keto is a western diet and relies heavily on non-veg food items and special ingredients like heavy whipped cream, which are not easily available in India,\" says Aurora, who shares her recipes on her website, ketoforindia.com.<br /><br />However great it may sound, keto is a controversial diet. The initial transition period, when the body is getting used to metabolizing fats for energy instead of carbs, can leave some dieters low in spirits and energy, with brain fog and nausea. These symptoms, called the 'keto flu', last for a couple of days. Because fruits are off-limits, dieters may also face constipation and certain nutrient deficiencies. Drawing lessons from his own experience with keto, Allahbadia doesn't recommend it to everyone, and only to those who have failed to lose weight by traditional workouts and diets.<br /><br /><strong>Priya's Menu: Priya Dogra Aurora lost 38kg with keto diet.

{"_id":"57fdc4efcf43e76842715ee2","title":"Try these foods to eat your water!","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e75bec71f6cb1a62d18","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We've all heard how drinking eight glasses or more of water per day is the best bet for good health. However, not many of us are able to achieve that target. This issue can be resolved though &mdash; and the best way to do that is to try and eat foods, especially fruits and vegetables that contain your daily requirement of H2O.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, there is no debate on whether anything can replace water. Remember, nothing beats drinking plenty of water, more so when you are exercising. At other times, you can try to include these hydrating foods in your diet which help you get more liquid for the body.<br />Water-enriched foods contain necessary nutrients, such as oleic acid, polyphenols and <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Vitamin-C-(musician)\">Vitamin C</a> which keep your body hydrated. If eating raw fruits and vegetables, is not your scene, try making smoothies, soups, juices or shakes out of these. Mix some strawberries in your yogurt, add pomegranate to your bowl of oatmeal, snack on celery sticks... the things you can do with the fruits and veggies is endless as this will surely help you stay hydrated.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cucumber - Water content: 96.7%</strong><br />While cucumbers are best during the summer, they are available in the market all-year-round, so make the best out of this veggie which has the highest water content amongst all vegetables. Just cut them into slices, sprinkle some chaat masala and serve or add them in salads. Cucumber sticks also make for excellent accompaniments with dips. To maximise the benefit out of the cucumber's hydrating power, you can blend it with yogurt, mint, and ice cubes to make a chilled cucumber soup, which makes for a refreshing drink and a delicious treat at the same time.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Radishes - Water content: 95.3%</strong><br />These root vegetables are a refreshing addition to your regular diet. With their mix of slightly spicy yet sweet flavour, they come filled with antioxidants such as catechin. Whether white or red, they have a crunchy texture making them perfect to eat as it is sliced or shredded and mixed with cabbage and carrots. Toss in some flax seeds powder, lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper, and you have a superb side dish.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Tomatoes\">Tomatoes</a> - Water content: 94.5%<br /></strong>Tomatoes make for an excellent hydrating snack. Just slice them and serve with a dash of salt and pepper or dice them, add peanut powder, yogurt, salt and cumin seeds powder to make a raita. You will find a variety of tomatoes in the supermarket. Try the sweet cherry and grape varieties, which are great to just pop in the mouth, along with some nuts or low-fat cheese. You can also make a basic tomato chutney with tomatoes, basil leaves, green chillies, salt and lime juice. This tastes best with dosas or you can use this as a dip.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cauliflower - Water content: 92.1%</strong><br />They might look pale, dry and solid, but cauliflower florets are packed with water content along with vitamins and phytonutrients that hep lower cholesterol and fight cancer. Boil them and add them to salads or grate raw cauliflower florets into atta, to roll out yummy parathas. Make some cauliflower soup or add the florets to your regular tomato soup to up the nutrition quotient. You can even pickle the florets to get the best out of them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Watermelon - Water content: 91.5% water</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">know that watermelon is full of water and can keep you hydrated for a long time. This juicy melon is also among the richest sources of lycopene, a cancer-fighting antioxidant found in red fruits and vegetables. In fact, watermelon contains more lycopene than raw tomatoes&mdash;about 12 milligrams per wedge, as compared to 3 milligrams per a medium-sized tomato. Just slice it and have it as it is or make a juice out of it. You can also keep a water pitcher in the fridge with watermelon cubes in the bottom to get that refreshing flavour which can motivate you to drink more water.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Strawberries - Water content: 91.0%</strong><br />Berries are good for hydration, and amongst all of them, juicy red strawberries are easily the best. While raspberries and blueberries have around 85% water, blackberries have 88.2%, which clearly has strawberries winning the race with 91%. Blended in a smoothie or mixed with plain non-fat yogurt, strawberries add natural sweetness to anything they are mixed with. The combination of water, carbohydrates, fibre, and protein make them a great post-workout recovery snack too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Grapefruit - Water content: 90.5%</strong></p>\n<div class=\"last7brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Grapefruits can help lower cholesterol and shrink your waistline so add this juicy, tangy citrus fruit to your daily diet. The compounds in the fruit help fuel fat burn and stabilize blood sugar, therefore helping to reduce cravings. Have a bowl of this fruit everyday or make a smoothie, with or without yogurt.</div>\n<div class=\"last7brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"last7brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Celery - Water content: 95.4%</strong>\n<div class=\"last5brdiv\">&nbsp;</div>\nThe high water content in celery neutralizes stomach acid making it a natural remedy for heartburn and acidity. Add to that the fact that it has very less calories &mdash; just 6 calories per stalk with a punch of fibre and water that helps to fill you up and curb your appetite. It also contains folate and vitamins A, C, and K.</div>\n<div class=\"last7brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"last7brdiv\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Green Pepper - Water content: 94%</strong>\n<div class=\"last3brdiv\">&nbsp;</div>\nWhile all shades of bell peppers have a high water content, green peppers lead as compared to the red and yellow varieties (which have about 92% water). They also contain just as many antioxidants as the coloured and slightly sweeter varieties. Add them to your salad and you get a colourful dish in no time at all. They are also great when cooked &mdash; just dice and toss with potatoes&nbsp;or&nbsp;paneer, add a dash of spices and salt and they make for an interesting starter while you wait for the main course.</div>\n<div class=\"last7brdiv\">&nbsp;</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/foods1476248804566.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf990af76df6bbfd6b63e","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"foods"},{"text":"eat"},{"text":"water"},{"text":"vitamin c"},{"text":"cucumber"},{"text":"radishes"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food/food-features/Try-these-foods-to-eat-your-water/articleshow/54735512.cms","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-12T05:06:55.875Z","udate":"2016-10-12T06:33:35.769Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-12T06:33:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fdc4efcf43e76842715ee4","id":"57fdc4efcf43e76842715ee2","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out2525.mp3","tagsForSearch":"foods,eat,water,vitamin c,cucumber,radishes","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Waiting for the Mahatma</strong><br />Waiting for the Mahatma is written in Narayan's gentle comic style. An unusual feature of this novel is the participation of Gandhi as a character. His revolutionary ideas and practices are contrasted with the views of traditionalists. The political struggle serves as a background to Sriram and Bharati's unconventional romance. This is one of Narayan's most successful novels, where much happens behind the facade of the low key storytelling.<br /><br /><strong>4. The Guide</strong><br />The name of novel recollects one of the finest movies of Indian cinema - Guide. Yes, the story was based on Narayan's novel. The novel brought its author the 1960 Sahitya Akademi Award for English, by the Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters.<br /><br /><strong>5. My Dateless Diary</strong><br />My Dateless Diary is a collection of autobiographical essays by R. K. Narayan published in 1960. The book is focused on Narayan's interactions with the Americans. The book also highlights Narayan's view of the west, his appreciation and admiration in general, but subtle disapproval of specific aspects while making it known that there isn't much of a gap between his values and those he has come across. The book offers insights into both, the author and his subjects.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/01484824979356.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"swami and friends"},{"text":"the dark room"},{"text":"waiting for the mahatma"},{"text":"the guide"},{"text":"my dateless diary"},{"text":"RK Narayan"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/books/Swami-and-Friends/photostory/54779160.cms","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-12T05:30:35.502Z","udate":"2017-01-19T11:22:42.418Z","expirydate":"2018-02-21T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2017-01-19T11:21:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fdca7b385fc92f1e4ee368","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out5015.mp3","audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"swami and friends,the dark room,waiting for the mahatma,the guide,my dateless diary,RK Narayan"}

Krishna has influenced the Indian thought, life and culture in myriad ways. He has influenced not only its religion and philosophy, but also into its mysticism and literature, painting and sculpture, dance and music, and all aspects of Indian folklore.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Time of the Lord</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Indian as well as Western scholars have now accepted the period between 3200 and 3100 BC as the period in which <a href=\"http://hinduism.about.com/od/festivalsholidays/f/When-Is-Krishna-Janmashtami.htm\" data-inlink=\"FpzJfFr4Q28EDqDl0A1pjQ==\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"5\">Lord Krishna</a> lived on earth. Krishna took birth at midnight on the <em>ashtami</em> or the 8th day of the <em>Krishnapaksha</em> or dark fortnight in the Hindu month of Shravan (August-September). The birthday of Krishna is called <a href=\"http://hinduism.about.com/od/festivalsholidays/a/janmashthami.htm\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"6\">Janmashthami</a>, a special occasion for Hindus that is celebrated around the world. The birth of Krishna is in itself a transcendental phenomenon that generates awe among the Hindus and overwhelms one and all with its supra mundane happenings.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Baby Krishna: Killer of Evils</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Stories about Krishna's exploits abound. Legends have it that on the very sixth day of his birth, Krishna killed lady demon Putna by sucking on her breasts. In his childhood, he also killed many other mighty demons, such as Trunavarta, Keshi, Aristhasur, Bakasur, Pralambasur <em>et al</em>. During the same period he also killed Kali Nag (<em>cobra de capello</em>) and made the holy water of river Yamuna poison free.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Krishna's Childhood Days</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Krishna made cowherdesses happy by the bliss of his cosmic dances and the soulful music of his flute. He stayed in Gokul, the legendary 'cow-village' in Northern India for 3 years and 4 months. As a child he was reputed to be very mischievous, stealing curd and butter and playing pranks with his girl friends or <em>gopis</em>. Having completed his <em>Lila</em> or exploits at Gokul, he went to <a href=\"http://hinduism.about.com/od/temples/p/Brindawan.htm\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"8\">Vrindavan</a> and stayed until he was 6 years and 8 months old.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to a famous legend, Krishn drove away the monsterous serpent Kaliya from the river to the sea. Krishna, according to another popular myth, lifted the Govardhana hill up with his little finger and held it like an umbrella to protect the people of Vrindavana from the torrential rain caused by Lord Indra, who had been annoyed by Krishna. Then he lived in Nandagram till he was 10.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Krishna's Youth and Education</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Krishna then returned to Mathura, his birthplace, and killed his wicked maternal uncle King Kamsa along with all his cruel associates and liberated his parents from jail. He also reinstated Ugrasen as the King of Mathura. He completed his education and mastered the 64 sciences and arts in 64 days at Avantipura under his preceptor Sandipani. As <em>gurudaksina</em> or tuition fees, he restored Sandipani's dead son to him. He stayed in Mathura till he was 28.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Krishna, the King of Dwarka</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Krishna then came to the rescue of a clan of Yadava chiefs, who were ousted by the king Jarasandha of Magadha. He easily triumphed over the multi-million army of Jarasandha by building an impregnable capital <a href=\"http://hinduism.about.com/od/temples/p/dwaraka.htm\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"11\">Dwarka</a>, \"the many-gated\" city in an island in the sea. The city located on the western point of Gujarat, is now submerged in the sea according to the epic Mahabharata. Krishna shifted, as the story goes, all his sleeping relatives and natives to Dwarka by the power of his yoga. In Dwarka, he married Rukmini, then Jambavati, and Satyabhama. He also saved his kingdom from Nakasura, the demon king of Pragjyotisapura, had abducted 16,000 princesses. Krishna freed them and married them since they had nowhere else to go.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Krishna, the Hero of the Mahabharata</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For many years, Krishna lived with the Pandava and Kaurava kings who ruled over Hastinapur. When a war was about to break oput between the Pandavas and Kauravas, Krishna was sent to mediate, but failed. War became inevitable, and Krishna offered his forces to the Kauravs and himself agreed to join the Panadavas as the charioteer of the master warrior Arjuna. This epic battle of Kurukshetra described in the <em><a href=\"http://hinduism.about.com/b/2007/04/30/the-complete-mahabharata.htm\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"12\">Mahabharata</a></em>, was fought in about 3000 BC. In the middle of the war, Krishna delivered his famous advice, which forms the crux of the Bhagavad Gita, in which he put forward the theory of 'Nishkam Karma' or action without attachment.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Krishna's Final Days on Earth</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After the great war, Krishna returned to Dwarka. In his final days on earth, he taught spiritual wisdom to Uddhava, his friend and disciple, and ascended to his abode after casting off his body, which was shot at by a hunter named Jara. He is believed to have lived for 125 years. Whether he was a human being or a God-incarnate, there is no gainsaying the fact that he has been ruling the hearts of millions for over three millennia. In the words of Swami Harshananda, \"If a person can affect such a profound impact on the Hindu race affecting its psyche and ethos and all aspects of its life for centuries, he is no less than God.\"</p>\n</div>\n</article>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/gopal-krishna-images1476252050538.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"krishna"},{"text":"lord"},{"text":"incarnation"},{"text":"vishnu"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57fb6fc4e66f216b816f52ca","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://hinduism.about.com/od/lordkrishna/a/krishna.htm","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-12T06:01:02.137Z","udate":"2016-10-12T06:43:05.388Z","expirydate":"2017-01-12T05:53:10.828Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-12T06:43:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fdd19ed0e65a6a84b34359","id":"57fdd19ed0e65a6a84b34357","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","tagsForSearch":"krishna,lord,incarnation,vishnu","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Researchers examined data from a population-based birth cohort of 2.4 million Swedish children born from 1973 to 1996 and followed up through 2013.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This group included about 17,000 people diagnosed with OCD, on average when they were around 23 years old. Within the birth cohort, researchers also looked at about 11,500 families with siblings that included at least one child with OCD and one without the diagnosis.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By doing this, researchers could look at differences among kids with similar genetic makeup and family circumstances that might help explain the development of OCD later in life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When mothers smoked at least 10 cigarettes a day during pregnancy, the risk of OCD in their child increased by 27 percent, researchers report in JAMA Psychiatry. A low Apgar score, which measures things like respiration, pulse and movements after birth, was linked to a 50 percent greater risk of OCD.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Breech babies, who are positioned feet down instead of head down in the uterus, had a 35 percent increased risk of OCD, while cesarean deliveries were associated with a 17 percent greater risk.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Overall, almost half of the people diagnosed with OCD during the study period had at least one risk factor from pregnancy or infancy, and many of them had more than one. The more of these perinatal risk factors a person had, the higher their risk of OCD.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The mechanism linking OCD to factors around the time of birth remains unknown, the authors point out. They note that adverse conditions during fetal development may subtly alter brain development and that some of the same risk factors emerging in this study, like low birthweight and being small for gestational age, have also been linked to increased risk for autism and ADHD.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One limitation of the study is that it focused more on severe cases of OCD that may not represent the entire population of people with this condition, they note in their report. The data only includes people who saw specialists for OCD, and not patients diagnosed by general practitioners.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even so, the findings bring scientists one step closer to understanding the biological underpinnings of OCD and may eventually lead to treatments to prevent the debilitating effects of this common disorder, Leckman said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;These findings have real public health significance,&rdquo; Leckman added. &ldquo;This is especially true of the increased risk associated with heavy maternal smoking during pregnancy, but it is also clear that as a society we need to make sure that all mothers and newborns have optimal medical care.&rdquo;</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/dc-Cover-jq37n7rkrvs68ldafr6gkaod94-201610120837111476252301207.jpeg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baab806a12cf7ee39133b8","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"breech babies"},{"text":"preterm birth"},{"text":"cesarean birth"},{"text":"autism"},{"text":"ocd"},{"text":"adolescence"},{"text":"pregnancy"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57ebc461b17dbb41078bbd0a","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/health-and-wellbeing/121016/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-may-be-traced-back-to-environment-at-birth.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-12T06:05:15.910Z","udate":"2016-10-12T09:57:07.658Z","expirydate":"2016-12-14T05:54:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-12T05:54:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fdd29bd0e65a6a84b34367","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out7500.mp3","tagsForSearch":"breech babies,preterm birth,cesarean birth,autism,ocd,adolescence,pregnancy","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57fdd4a3f0b8064697ceabe2","title":"‘The short story is a snapshot’","subtitle":"Arunava Sinha, who recently translated a volume of Bengali short stories, talks of the need to build an ecosystem to teach translated Indian literature in universities","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb900dea63af2cd0d814cf","content":"<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Arunava Sinha&rsquo;s <em>The Greatest Bengali Stories Ever Told</em> comes with a caveat. In his introduction, he writes that the short stories in this collection have been chosen not according to literary canons or eras or any other form of &ldquo;critical sieving&rdquo;, but simply because these are stories that have loomed large in his life, and that he loves. Translated into English over a period of five years, the stories are ordered chronologically from Tagore&rsquo;s <em>The Kabuliwala </em>to Amar Mitra&rsquo;s<em>Air and Water</em>, and Sinha believes they act as a map, allowing a younger generation to rediscover and reconnect with a legacy of reading. We spoke about the continuance of the Bengali short story, about melancholy and being unambitious. Excerpts from an interview:</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>You say you chose these stories because there&rsquo;s a quality that haunts the characters, a sense of something missing. Why is this appealing to you?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">I probably need to psychoanalyse myself for that but it resonates with something within me. It&rsquo;s a very personal response but in some ways anybody who&rsquo;s involved with writing, whether it&rsquo;s your own work or translations, I think there&rsquo;s always a seeking. I&rsquo;m not trying to over-intellectualise it, but there&rsquo;s always something out of your reach, and then there are certain aspects of my life that fit in with this whole business of looking and not finding.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Many of these stories are to do with families and hierarchies; would you agree that there&rsquo;s a lot of social commentary worked in here as well?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bengal is a small piece of land with 160 million people, very densely packed, so there&rsquo;s not much scope for isolation. Every-thing is within the context of the people around you, so you can&rsquo;t take that out of any piece of fiction that&rsquo;s written there. And yes, anything that&rsquo;s been written has always been trying to say that all is not right, something needs to change. I suppose if that hadn&rsquo;t been there, why would you write? We&rsquo;d be doing sunshine good morning reports. I&rsquo;d say there&rsquo;s almost no problem of family that India or South East Asia has faced that has not been a powerful one in Bengal as well. Apply any kind of guillotine, you&rsquo;ll find that Bengal fits in somewhere.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Could you talk about the continuance of the Bengali short story because the youngest entrant in your anthology was born in 1951. What happens after that?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It proceeds to go in different directions &mdash; one direction is the very conventional, Maupassant/ O. Henry school &mdash; small settings, small canvas, straightforward narration, which feeds into the non-demanding reader. The other school has moved in specific areas of women&rsquo;s rights, feminism, some motives of behaviour and liberation both in terms of sexual, economic and social choices, but it&rsquo;s still conventional narration. And then there&rsquo;s the third school, which is very experimental, which does away with form or structure, and which probably writes only for its own members, and can sometimes be quite baffling and opaque. It&rsquo;s been hard to find people who have written consistently outstanding short fiction. Also, you have to give it a little bit of time. Some stories might appeal to you in the here and now, but a few years down the line they might appear tame.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Were there particular writers you found easier or more difficult to translate?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Buddhadeva Bose&rsquo;s words resonate with me in the most satisfying way. It&rsquo;s like when you&rsquo;re trying to sing and the song just falls into place, it doesn&rsquo;t mean the song is easy, but it&rsquo;s just right for you. He&rsquo;s one of those writers whose rhythms seem to match mine, whereas some writers&rsquo; work never seems to end, you know? (laughs). Nabarun Bhattacharya was difficult simply because his language has so much energy, and it&rsquo;s so street, it&rsquo;s tough. His mother, Mahasweta Devi, also carried a certain kind of energy, and to translate them it&rsquo;s almost like method acting &mdash; you literally have to work up a body of sweat as you&rsquo;re translating, because you need that same energy to flow from beginning to end.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>There was one sentence from Satyajit Ray&rsquo;s <em>Two Magicians</em> which stayed with me. &ldquo;Being Bengali didn&rsquo;t mean being unambitious.&rdquo; Do you think short stories can provide a glimpse into a particular community, in terms of characterising?</strong></p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It&rsquo;s a good point. What it does, the short story, is more of a snapshot, right? It&rsquo;s capturing a society and the people at a particular point of time. Each of them convey a photographic image to me of some kind, so it&rsquo;s very helpful that way. It&rsquo;s difficult to be an insider and to think of what it might be like for someone who&rsquo;s standing outside, who&rsquo;s not a Bengali.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Am I right in thinking there&rsquo;s a special place for melancholy in Bengali literature?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">I think the question would be, is there a place for joy? (Laughs). So much melancholy! That line of Ray&rsquo;s of being unambitious &mdash; it&rsquo;s quite right, because for a long time the idea was that you cannot overcome your limitations of space and time that you&rsquo;ve been born into, so you better make the most of it and find your fulfilment in art and literature and relationships and so on, but your work and career are not necessarily going to be the defining elements of your life. While this was the common thread, in more perceptive minds there was a sense that there is a big gap between potential and actual achievement and also a stoic acceptance of this, and I think that&rsquo;s what led to the melancholy.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>So, it&rsquo;s connected, the lack of ambition and the melancholy?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yes, somewhere this notion that big change will not happen and with that acceptance comes this sense of gloom, which then, when channelled in artistic terms, comes up with a very fine sensibility rather than just a pouring out of angst. With the political enlightenment of the 1960s onwards, people started changing rather than accepting. You would probably therefore see more anger, more rebellion, louder voices in the second half of the book.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Yes, there&rsquo;s a sense of opening up in the later stories, even in terms of language, it suddenly starts to feel more modern.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">From the 1960s, there was much more of a plugging into what was going on elsewhere in the world both politically and artistically. So what happened in Vietnam fired an entire generation. Simultaneously, there was experimental writing. So when Allen Ginsberg visited Calcutta, he became a big influence on people like Sunil Gangopadhyay, and for the first time they sort of started thinking it&rsquo;s all right to play with what you&rsquo;re writing and give vent to other things rather than just a fine, classical sensibility. Of course, you also had more middle class and subaltern voices, it wasn&rsquo;t just the privileged people writing.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What can you say about the state of translation in India today. Is it enough?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It&rsquo;s never enough even though it&rsquo;s better than it was five or 10 years ago. I have two hopes. One is that Indian universities will start teaching Indian literature in translation in a systematic way. Aruni Kashyap and I taught a course on Indian literature in translation at Ashoka University recently, and the response from the students was amazing. They said for the first time they realised that literature was about our lives; they didn&rsquo;t have that sense earlier. Second, I&rsquo;m hoping that all writers who write in English will be able to read this stuff and carry on this tradition. I have a feeling Indian writers in English sometimes find themselves a little adrift, and I&rsquo;m hoping that this large body of translations will help to place them on a literary historical level.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/story1476252823555.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babcefb210157e920b07f9","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"arunava sinha"},{"text":"the greatest bengali stories ever told"},{"text":"translation"},{"text":"tishani doshi"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/books/literary-review/arunava-sinha-talks-to-tishani-doshi-on-the-state-of-translation-in-india-today/article9197488.ece","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-12T06:13:55.036Z","udate":"2016-10-12T06:43:05.388Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-12T06:43:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fdd4a3f0b8064697ceabe4","id":"57fdd4a3f0b8064697ceabe2","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out9384.mp3","tagsForSearch":"arunava sinha,the greatest bengali stories ever told,translation,tishani doshi","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

So, if a person starts playing the violin and says that she loves her classes immensely, but gives up after a year saying she prefers art to music, she will not qualify as passionate as her interests have changed in a relatively short period.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Perseverance, on the other hand, refers to the effort a person is willing to invest in a long-term goal. Steadfastly practising for two hours daily, for five consecutive years, is clearly a sign of being able to persist. Thus, as Duckworth and her colleague Patrick Quinn write in a 2010 issue of <em>Journal of Personality Assessment</em>, &ldquo;Grit entails the capacity to sustain both effort and interest in projects that take months or even longer to complete.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">While Duckworth acknowledges that talent also has a role to play in skill acquisition, she says that it is overrated in terms of how far it can take us. One child may learn dance steps much faster than her peers, but her friend, who needs more repetitions to master a step, may over time grow into a more graceful dancer because she invests more time perfecting her leg movements. Even as innate proclivities may help us acquire skills faster, we are unlikely to achieve much in the long-term unless we put in consistent and steadfast effort to hone those talents.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Besides working hard, another signature feature of those with grit is that they don&rsquo;t let setbacks, either innate or external, hamper their overarching goal.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Duckworth profiles inspiring individuals who are beacons of tenacity. For three years, aspiring cartoonist Robert Mankoff accumulated no less than 2,000 rejection slips from <em>The New Yorker</em> before his first cartoon was accepted in 1977. Over the next three years, he managed to get 65 cartoons published by the magazine. In 1981, he became their contract cartoonist.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Likewise, the celebrated American novelist, John Irving, didn&rsquo;t exhibit much promise as a student. In fact, his high school English grade was a C-. It was only when his son was diagnosed as dyslexic, did Irving realise that he too probably struggled with a similar issue.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">But that didn&rsquo;t stop him from becoming a bestselling and prolific author. As he struggled to read and write, he &ldquo;came to appreciate that in doing something over and over again, something that was never natural becomes almost second nature.&rdquo;</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">While we may appreciate the role played by grit in a person&rsquo;s success, can we change our levels of grit? Can a person grow more or less gritty with age? Like most psychological constructs, grit too depends on an interplay of nature and nurture. Even though we cannot alter the genes we inherit, our grit levels are not fixed in stone either.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to gathering systematic data through questionnaires, Duckworth has also interviewed a number of &ldquo;paragons of grit&rdquo;. Her research reveals that gritty people have certain commonalities. Foremost, they are deeply interested in what they do. Next, they engage in &ldquo;deliberate practice,&rdquo; a term coined by psychologist Anders Ericsson who has studied expertise across varied domains. Deliberate practice involves taking your skill or knowledge to the next level by engaging in focussed sessions with preset goals that target your specific weaknesses. Gritty individuals, as they mature in their domain, cultivate a purpose that is larger than themselves. For example, most sporting champions at the international level say that winning a medal for their country is important for them. Finally, gritty people embody hope. When faced with setbacks, they don&rsquo;t throw down the mantle. Instead, they try to overcome or circumvent obstacles that may derail them from achieving their goals.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sport is where we often see grit on display. Gymnast Dipa Karmakar finished fourth at the recently concluded Rio Olympics, but she is not despondent at not winning a medal. Instead, she has already set her sights on winning gold at the 2020 Games.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Star badminton coach P. Gopichand&rsquo;s comments suggest that he fosters grit in his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. As reported in <em>The Hindu</em> (August 23, 2016), he says, &ldquo;So, when we look back, it is not just about whether you have won a medal or not. What is important is whether you put your heart and soul into it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In order to imbue his players with a larger purpose, Gopichand would apparently ask P.V. Sindhu and K. Srikanth to sing the national anthem before every match. Evidently, this coach understands that skill in badminton has to be accompanied by a gritty self in order to make it in the world of sport. Small wonder that he has mentored so many stellar players.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Aruna Sankaranarayanan is director, Prayatna: Centre for Educational Assessment &amp; Intervention.</em></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/09SM_SINDHU1_3037200f1476254648952.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babcefb210157e920b07f9","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"passion"},{"text":"perseverance"},{"text":"angela duckworth"},{"text":"grit: the power of passion & perseverance"},{"text":"aruna sankaranarayanan"},{"text":"sports"},{"text":"dipa karmakar"},{"text":"p. gopichand"},{"text":"p.v. sindhu"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/aruna-sankaranarayanan-on-that-thing-called-grit/article9197332.ece","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-12T06:44:20.831Z","udate":"2016-10-12T06:45:58.955Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-12T06:43:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fddbc4f0b8064697ceac27","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out7743.mp3","tagsForSearch":"passion,perseverance,angela duckworth,grit: the power of passion & perseverance,aruna sankaranarayanan,sports,dipa karmakar,p. gopichand,p.v. sindhu","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57fddc6ce66f216b816f5c9d","title":"The artful decade","subtitle":"The New Festival keeps faith with both eclecticism and modernism","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;If equal affection cannot be, let the more loving one be me.&rdquo; This sentiment from 20th century poet Auden could well be the lyrics of a 9th century Alwar or Nayanar, sparking Chennai-based Prakriti Foundation in its 21st century service to the modern muse, an adventurous effort in a heavily traditional milieu.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">In partnership with The Park hotels and a number of well-wishers, Prakriti Foundation curates an annual festival of performing arts dedicated to emerging and new work in the country and from abroad. Ten years old this year, The Park&rsquo;s New Festival can look back with satisfaction at the increasing affection garnered from audiences now in six cities &mdash; Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai and New Delhi.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">At the just-concluded Delhi festival, the venue was full for a fusion concert by two Indians, Shashank Subramanyam and Ojas Adhiya, the now grown-up child prodigies on the bamboo flute and tabla. Their musical partners were the Romanian-Swedish trio Lelo Nika, Thommy Anderson and George Mihalache on the accordion, cello and the cimbalom, respectively. In particular, accordionist Nika&rsquo;s range was dashing and dreamy, fiery and spiritual. The group explored thrilling Romanian gypsy airs, a deeply rhythmic Swedish folk song with jazz improvisations, and Raag Yaman Kalyani with grace notes of Jagadodharana. This rare, delicious experience took me back in time to the banks of the Cauvery in Thiruvarur, where I heard Subramanyam and Adhiya play at the Festival of Sacred Music eight years ago. That too was an endeavour by Prakriti Foundation, in collaboration with the district authorities and local institutions.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">I caught a glimpse of the first edition of The New Festival in December 2007, during the music season, and it was like being offered two worlds. Hardcore Carnatica was on in full swing at The Music Academy and other sabhas, creating sanctuaries of sound.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">New Festival offered a wildly diverse mix: a dance-drama by Mallika Sarabhai on the Devi Mahatmaya, Ramu Ramanathan&rsquo;s play <em>Jazz</em>, the delicate production &lsquo;Porcelain&rsquo; by Walter and Tobias Sturmer with Preethi Athrey&rsquo;s solo, a play on Annie Besant, and a production by Dance Routes called &lsquo;Dhara&rsquo; that was based on Odiya Patachitra paintings.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">The curatorial intention was crystal-clear from that first edition: to bring together tradition and modernity, east and west, north and south, and new explorations of the old. My understanding of that first playbill was that it sought to vivify the Gandhian credo: &ldquo;I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the culture of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible. But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any.&rdquo;</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\">But would a culturally fragmented and possibly unexposed, indifferent public care? Would Indian audiences resist being coaxed, ever so pleasantly, out of their comfort zone?</div>\n<p class=\"body\">The first response was mildly encouraging &mdash; after all, these productions were unexceptionable. And so, with renewed commitment, the festival pushed the envelope a little further, still staying on this side of &lsquo;safe&rsquo; in its next edition with a puppet play on Ram in the Balinese style and installation art with interactive dances &mdash; old hat to Indian Council for Cultural Relations&rsquo; pampered Delhi but new for &lsquo;Singara Chennai&rsquo;.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">The festival stayed in Chennai for its first three years but in 2010, it sprang out boldly to three more state capitals &mdash; Hyderabad, Kolkata and New Delhi. Its content grew more experimental &mdash; Shiv Shakti, a duetto with Dhurba Ghosh on the sarangi and Ernest Rombout on the alto oboe, exploring three sets of ragas: Shankara-Durga, Bhairav-Bhairavi and Jaunpuri-Asaveri; a musical puppet show called Bollywood Bandwagon; and a turn by Vidur Kapoor, the stand-up comic.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">In 2011, the festival&rsquo;s fifth edition grew to a six-city event with the addition of Bengaluru and Mumbai, and it has sustained this span so far. In terms of content, I cannot think of another festival as steadily eclectic except the 16-year-old International Dance Festival curated by Thailand&rsquo;s first ballerina, Vararom Pachimsawat, and her Friends-of-the-Arts Foundation, in which India participated for the first time in 2012. Interestingly, when Protein Dance, the English company, presented its witty production &lsquo;LOL&rsquo; on love in the internet era at this festival, its next destination was Chennai, and they were guests of Prakriti Foundation.</p>\n<p class=\"body\"><em>Renuka Narayanan lives in New Delhi and writes on religion, art and culture.

{"_id":"57fddcf7e66f216b816f5ca9","title":"A complete performer","subtitle":"Danseuse Rama Vaidyanathan feels that it is important to make our dance as accessible as possible to as many people as possible, without losing its aesthetic qualities","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is a separate section on Bharatanatyam dancer Rama Vaidyanathan&rsquo;s website called &lsquo;technical requirements&rsquo;. This section is devoted to details such as the platform for orchestra, its size and where it needs to be placed on stage, what the audio system for the performance needs to comprise, the different kinds of lights and even elucidates what the green room must have.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">While this is primarily meant for organisers abroad, I was still struck by the amount of planning and the idea that it is the dancer&rsquo;s responsibility too to go into such detail-in all their minutiae.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As we sat down for a conversation in the green room of Chowdiah Memorial Hall, I realised that this is not unusual for Rama Vaidyanathan. A recipient of the Kalaimaamani from the Tamil Nadu State Government and the &lsquo;Best Dancer Award&rsquo; from The Music Academy, Chennai among other laurels, Rama believes that it is a dancer&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure a performance is perfectly devised.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;We are in the 21st century and no longer just confined to the courtyard of the temple. We are performing for a wide variety of audience across the world and Bharatanatyam, while it is spiritual and philosophical, is beyond an ethnic or a religious dance form. The idea is to make our dance as accessible as possible to as many people as possible. For that, it needs to be perfectly packaged while retaining an aesthetic sense and a deep insight simultaneously,&rdquo; she explained.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The compositions she had chosen for that day&rsquo;s performance were in themselves examples of what she meant by the &lsquo;perfect package&rsquo;. They were different, contemporary, accessible and yet deeply rooted in traditional concepts.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In <em>Sannidhanam</em>, the alaripu in Rama&rsquo;s hands, became a composition that is used to describe the architecture of a temple. The navarasas are hardly new when it comes to Bharatanatyam but Rama managed to present them differently too. In <em>Navarasa Mohana</em>, she stretched a four-line verse in the Bhagavatam into a 30-minute performance detailing the nine different reactions of people to Krishna when he reached Mathura to kill his uncle, Kamsa. She ended her recital with a Thumri in which Radha out of her love for Krishna, <em>becomes</em> him. &ldquo;I chose these compositions specifically because I have not performed them before a Bangalore audience.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">These are compositions that completely represent me. They show my take on Bharatanatyam choreography.&rdquo;</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trained by illustrious gurus such as the legendary dancer Yamini Krishnamurthy and the iconic Saroja Vaidyanathan, who also happens to be Rama&rsquo;s mother-in-law, Rama has spent her life immersed in dance. &ldquo;I went to learn under Yamini <em>amma </em>when I was six years old. I don&rsquo;t think anybody has been as fortunate to learn from her the way I have been able to. I was her first student and she gave her best years of teaching to me. It was a routine that was gruelling but I did not feel it at that time. I used to look forward to my classes. She gave me a lot of affection and never intimidated me. But she also taught in a no-nonsense manner,&rdquo; remembers Rama. It was Rama&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s dream to make her a dancer. &ldquo;My mother used to gently prod me to even miss my play time and instead go to dance class. It was a very big achievement for her to see me make a name in dance. She passed away in February early this year. She was my inspiration- my biggest fan and an equally significant critic.&rdquo;</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">If the technique was planted, sharpened and perfected under Yamini <em>amma</em>, it was under Saroja Vaidyanathan that Rama says she became a professional dancer. &ldquo;The day I got married was the day I became a professional dancer. My mother-in-law groomed me to know what kind of items to present in a performance, how to dress, contact organisers, work with the musicians and the press etc. These three women have groomed me in three crucial ways.&rdquo; So, shaped by such solid teachers, was it easy for Rama, therefore, to craft her own style? &ldquo;It is not enough to give a person a fish to eat, one also must teach him or her to fish. That is the only way he will be able to eat fish everyday. My gurus not only taught me the language but also how to use it. They gave me the freedom to explore.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">And Rama adds, that a style that was distinctly hers is not something that emerged overnight.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I kept tinkering with my dance for years and began a deep love affair with it. As you grow older, you start seeking answers to questions about life, death, happiness and so on. What happens in the life of an artist is that he or she often finds the answers to these questions in their own <em>sadhana</em>, their dance. I feel that perhaps, as I searched for the answers, the quest as well as my inferences began to be reflected in my perception of a composition, how I approached abhinaya, the kind of compositions I chose etc. I only noticed a style and a distinct perception emerging when others pointed it out to me.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">One question that Rama feels dancers today are preoccupied with is whether they should stick to what their gurus have taught them or if they should fly freely and explore. &ldquo;Some dancers stick to what they have taught and are successful, some others break out and explore new concepts and forms and are successful. Their success is not because of either of these decisions. Their success is because the dancers are in pursuit of excellence. Without devoting a number of years to one&rsquo;s sadhana and without conviction, no excellence is possible.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">How would Rama describe the present in terms of where Bharatanatyam is today? &ldquo;It is like a Diwali, a celebration. Every street has teachers and there is nothing wrong with it. Yes, quality is a concern but it is only possible for two good dancers to emerge out of a pool of 1000,&rdquo; she explains.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/30BGFRRAMA_VAIDYAN_3027321g1476254955944.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babcefb210157e920b07f9","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"rama vaidyanathan"},{"text":"bharatanatyam"},{"text":"saroja vaidyanathan"},{"text":"yamini krishnamurthy"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/a-complete-performer/article9162538.ece","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-12T06:49:27.792Z","udate":"2016-10-12T06:50:41.349Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-12T06:49:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fddcf7e66f216b816f5cab","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out9669.mp3","tagsForSearch":"rama vaidyanathan,bharatanatyam,saroja vaidyanathan,yamini krishnamurthy","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

In times when gender roles are being constantly renegotiated, this year, two plays attempt to take the discourse to a new stage, a level where there is fluidity between genders and timelines.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Director Purva Naresh&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ladies Sangeet&rdquo;, attempts to delineate the classical nayika in a world where selfie sounds like an abbreviation of selfish. Apart from being a playwright, Purva is a trained Kathak dancer and loves to play mridangam. &ldquo;It was one of the things that were playing on my mind for a long time. I was trying to define nayika. As I am student of Indian classical dance and music, I wanted to explore the space of contemporary Indian woman in traditional nayika. As I am also a film student, I am also concerned about what is sensuality, what is femininity and what defines beauty, the idea of shringar in today&rsquo;s world, where we have several magazines and events dedicated to bride.&rdquo; When an opportunity came to write a play to draw people into theatre, Purva decided to place this serious thought in a very popular setting &ndash; ladies sangeet during a wedding.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Purva says it is a disguised discourse as she doesn&rsquo;t want to give a definitive ending. &ldquo;But, all through explores definitions of femininity in popular culture &ndash; from folks songs and fashion to bridal shows and Bollywood.&rdquo; She refers to folk songs like &ldquo;Main raja bholi mera ghar na luta dena&rdquo;, which establishes the girl as a na&iuml;ve damsel and &ldquo;Chhoti si motor car lekar aana&rdquo; where the girl puts pressure on the boy. \"When this folk song was written, small car would have been a big thing,&rdquo; wonders Purva. Absolutely, but isn&rsquo;t it aspirational in a consumerist society? &ldquo;It is not a criticism. It is a reflection of the society, and how folk cultures put pressure on us.&rdquo; The idea behind working with these idioms, says Purva, is to keep evaluating ourselves and to figure out the space for individuality in the cultural motifs that are handed over to us.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">On who defines beauty, Purva says whoever has defined it there is an element of male gaze in it. &ldquo;When a nayika dresses up, she is looking for the attention of nayak. Over the years, the impossible cuts and the various corsets that we see in fashion are meant to accentuate those body parts which women never gaze at in other women,&rdquo; remarks Purva. She admits that it might sound like generalisation but here she is talking about the average Indian women and the play also focuses on them by showcasing different generations of women in a ladies sangeet ceremony. Each generation has it icons and trends, but Purva says only idioms change over time, the thought remains the same.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Role reversal</strong></p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Talking of idioms, actor-director Sheena Khalid uses drag as a means to celebrate fluidity of gender and renegotiate gender roles in &ldquo;The Gentlemen&rsquo;s Club aka Tape.&rdquo; To be showcased in Delhi for the first time, the play is about a fictitious underground club in Mumbai where girls dress up as men. &ldquo;The project started when Vikram Phukan, Puja Sarup and myself got interested in doing something around drag kings. There is an amazing community in Mumbai called the Gaysi. They organise an event once a year and asked us to create something for them.&rdquo; The performance worked and finally they performed at the centre stage of Mumbai&rsquo;s NCPA.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Puja dresses up as Shammi Kapoor and Sheena plays multiple characters include Justin Timberlake. &ldquo;We picked Shammi Kapoor because he was not an over the top macho hero. There was a soft beautiful quality about him and that&rsquo;s what excited all of us. Similarly, Justin Timberlake is also not your manly man.&rdquo; Sheena clarifies their choices don&rsquo;t mean that all women like such men. &ldquo;This is what excited us. Mukti Mohan plays a fictitious Sikh man Harpal Singh, who is based on her experiences of growing up in Delhi. Ratnabali Bhattacharjee plays Mr.55, a pro-revolution guy, quite like a man&rsquo;s man,&rdquo; says the graduate from London International School of Performing Arts.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are used to watching drag queens in our television series and films but Sheena says it is very rare to find women dressing up as men in popular culture. &ldquo;Even when they do, it is usually as a form of disguise. Drag is not about disguise. For us, it is a medium to celebrate masculinity and femininity. There is no special story, no moral of the story.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that audiences go looking for some girls dancing to Shammi Kapoor&rsquo;s numbers. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t have a linear storyline and is essentially a peek into this Gentleman&rsquo;s Club. It is an experiential piece.&rdquo; For the performance the actors have to tape their chests and that is what the title reflects.

The septugenarian’s dedication is evident as she talks about her experience as a Nangiarkoothu performer.","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nangiarkoothu, a solo female performance, is a derivative of the age-old Sanskrit theatre of Koodiyattam. Its leitmotif is &lsquo;Sree Krishna Charitam&rsquo;, presented as Nirvahanam (pre-story recital) by Kalpalathika, the maid-companion of Subhadra in the second act of the play &lsquo;Subhadra Dhananjayam&rsquo; authored by Kulasekhara.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The art form shot into prominence only during the last 25 years, thanks to the relentless effort of doyens Ammannur Madhava Chakyar and Painkulam Rama Chakyar. The popularity it enjoys today could be attributed to quite a few outstanding artistes groomed in institutions such as Ammannur Gurukulam, Irinjalakuda, Kerala Kalamandalam and Margi in Thiruvananthapuram,</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">But Sarojini Nangiar, who turned 77 last week, is a notable exception in that she learnt it in the traditional way as part of <em>kuladharma</em>. When Sangeet Natak Akademi, New Delhi, selected her for its award this year, she was making history since she would be the first Nangiar to receive this national honour. This is in recognition of her dedication to the art form, notwithstanding myriad constraints.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Born in Edanad Nambiar Madhom, Chowara, near Aluva, Sarojini was trained by her mother, as it was done traditionally. Her arangettam was at the age of seven in the nearby temple. Ravunni Nambiar, her father, was well known in the Koodiyattam circles and had associated with the stalwarts of his days.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Those were days of scarcity owing to World War II and my father had to struggle to procure even the necessary clothes for my arangettam,&rdquo; reminisced the septuagenarian artiste who still can&rsquo;t believe she was chosen for the honour.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nangiarkoothu apart, the presence of a Nangiar is considered a must for Prabhandham Koothu as well as Koodiyattam. Seated on the floor on the left side of the stage, she keeps rhythm on the kuzhithalam (small cymbals) and recites slokas. Although customarily Sarojini&rsquo;s family used to accompany performances of the Mani family, she has associated with all Chakyars including the young ones on the stage, except Ammannur Chachu Chakyar.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, Sarojini is the only Nangiar who had had the privilege of performing in temples across Kerala, either for accompaniment or as a Nangiarkoothu artiste.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tripunithura Poornathrayeesha temple stands out among the performing venues for she has been staging Nangiarkoothu without a break for the last five decades and more here. Sarojini proudly wears a gold chain with a pendant, which was presented by the temple for her long term service and commitment to the art form. Age did not prevent her from accompanying &lsquo;Mathavilasam&rsquo; that was staged at Chemmaniyode, near Nilambur, last week.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A stickler to tradition, Sarojini performs in temples only. Perhaps the only occasion when she performed outside the premises of a temple was during the first three years of Tourism Week celebrations of the government from 1980.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Confining herself to the temples where only the traditional play &lsquo;Sree Krishna Charitam&rsquo; is staged has prevented her from attempting new choreography. But she has no regrets and nothing against innovative attempts by other artistes.</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Costumes of Nangiarkoothu have undergone a sea change over the years but only the traditional simple ones are used by her even today. Sarojini said that there had been invitations from senior Chakyars to accompany them at venues outside the temples that could fetch her a handsome remuneration, but she never obliged them.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Over the years, the number of temples promoting Nangiarkoothu has dwindled considerably. As of now only those at Chottanikkara, Tripunithura, Vadakkunnathan, Angadippuram and Pazhayannur have been organising the performances regularly.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">At present, many temples shower gifts and renumeration on all other artistes except those of Koodiyattam especially during the annual festivities. This is really discouraging, she pointed out. &ldquo;But I am particular that the tradition shall never be broken. It is this commitment that compels me to perform even at this age,&rdquo; she added.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">What inspires her to train her grandchildren for their arangettam is this determination. &ldquo;But I am wonder how many of them will take it up as a profession as they are educated and can get other jobs,&rdquo; she admits. However, her sons Kalamandalam Narayanan Nambiar and Edanad Ramachandran Nambiar are professional mizhavu artistes.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">True, it has been a life full of hardships. To eke out her meagre income from performances, Sarojini took to weaving at the age of 16 and worked for Khadi Board until she was 64.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Incidentally, the Sangeet Natak Akademi award is the only honour Sarojini has won during the seven decades of her continuous stint as an artiste.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She is sore that neither the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi or other cultural institutions of the Kerala government have never taken note of her service.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/sarojini1476256151581.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babcefb210157e920b07f9","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"sarojini nangiar"},{"text":"nangiarkoothu"},{"text":"sangeet natak akademi award"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/sarojini-nangiar-has-been-awarded-the-sangeet-natak-akademi-award-for-2015/article9192076.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-12T07:09:22.877Z","udate":"2016-10-12T09:16:45.658Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-12T09:16:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fde1a2385fc92f1e4ee4bd","id":"57fde1a2385fc92f1e4ee4bb","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out4110.mp3","tagsForSearch":"sarojini nangiar,nangiarkoothu,sangeet natak akademi award","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57fde23138939368e0c05d01","title":"Play of emotions","subtitle":"Margi Raman Chakyar and Margi Visishta came good in their performances at Margi’s monthly programme in the capital city.","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A solo act in Koodiyattam and another one in Nangiarkoothu were presented on two days at Margi as part of the centre&rsquo;s monthly event. Margi Raman Chakyar and Margi Visishta were the two performers on the stage.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Effortless presentation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Viewers were in awe as the actor entered the scene with a loud scream and a fearful expression. Later it was revealed that the character was Sankhukarna and he was running towards Ravana to report Hanuman's misdeeds at Ashokavani, the palace garden. The purappadu act of Sankhukarna, from &lsquo;Thoranayudham&rsquo; play, thus got to a gripping start.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">At the palace door he was stopped by the doorkeeper Vijaya, who wanted to know why he was so frightened. Sankhukarna described the happenings at Ashokavani, but the focus was on how dear the garden was to Ravana. It was not Hanuman who frightened him, but the fact that Ravana was going to be enraged on knowing about present state of the garden. To ascertain his point, Sankhukarna cited two incidents; first one involving Mandodari, Ravana's beloved, who told her maids not to pluck the tender leaves, even if it was for decorating her, as it would upset Ravana. The situation was presented in Pakarnattam, a technique in which the actor narrates things from the perspective of each character. It was quite effective, as Raman Chakyar effortlessly switched between the characters of Mandodari, her maids and even Vijaya, which, sometimes, gets presented by another actor.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the second part, Sankhukarna narrated how Ravana stopped the Sun god from entering the garden, as he found that the rays were wearing out the plants in the garden. The arrogance of Ravana was on display and Raman Chakyar managed to do that fairly well.</p>\n<div id=\"inarticle_wrapper_div\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The valorous Jarasandha</strong></p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Margi Visishta presented 'Jarasandhayudham&rsquo; episode from 'Sreekrishnacharitham&rsquo; Nangiarkoothu on the second evening. The wives of Kamsa, knowing about their husband's death at the hands of Krishna, sought refuge with their father Jarasandha. Knowing about their ill fate, Jarasandha got angry and decided to seek revenge.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jarasandha became the pivotal character here and it's his valour that got prime attention. While it's not easy for even veterans to sustain the valorous character throughout a play, Margi Visishta, though early in her career, did a fine job in portraying Jarasandha, with all the energy and stamina the character demanded. Earlier, while presenting the bereaved wives of Kamsa who were being consoled by their father, Visishta also showed she certainly has the skills not only to act, but also to make one feel for her characters. May be, she could just flare up the anger a bit more in her characters, especially in Jarasandha, to make it even more impressive. The rest of the portions were action packed, as Jarasandha prepares for the war. Visishta again came good, as she did all those manoeuvres representing different weaponry in style.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jarasandha along with his army marched to Mathura and challenged Krishna and Balrama for a battle. However, all his powers proved to be no of use against the brothers and eventually he gets defeated twice. Fate favoured Jarasandha, as Balrama spared his life, upon hearing a divine voice that reminded him that Jarasandha&rsquo;s death should be at the hands of Bhima. While Visishta continued to do well in her recital, she could have paced it in a better way and at times she was too quick, making it a tad hard to follow the narrative.</p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">On both days, the percussion had Kalamandalam Sajikumar and Margi Mahesh on the mizhavu and Margi Mohanan on the thimila. Margi Usha and Margi Amrutha were on the cymbals.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/07tvf_raman_3035358g1476256294577.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babcefb210157e920b07f9","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"margi"},{"text":"margi visishta"},{"text":"margi raman chakyar"},{"text":"koodiyattam"},{"text":"nangiarkoothu"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/margi-raman-chakyar-and-margi-visishta-came-good-in-their-performances/article9192040.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-12T07:11:45.867Z","udate":"2016-10-12T09:16:45.658Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-12T09:16:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fde23138939368e0c05d03","id":"57fde23138939368e0c05d01","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out1536.mp3","tagsForSearch":"margi,margi visishta,margi raman chakyar,koodiyattam,nangiarkoothu","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"57fde7b200eec80f78b1fa32","title":"Art of the matter","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Bengaluru has seen a surge in street art through initiatives by individuals, groups and festivals over the past decade or so. </strong><br /><br />The latest among these is the St+Art Festival, organised by St+Art India Foundation and brought to town by Asian Paints and Srishti School of Art and Design's Art In Transit. The ongoing festival has 15 artists, from India and abroad, working across the city.<br /><br />&ldquo;We have quite a few artists from the city who will help bring out narratives specific to Bengaluru through the art,&rdquo; says Akshath Nauriyal, co-founder and content director of the festival.<br /><br />&ldquo;Bengaluru already has a lot of street art, in fact, a lot more than in most Indian cities I've seen,\" he continues. The festival has seen three runs in Delhi and another in Mumbai.<br /><br />The artists will be working in and around Indiranagar, MG Road, Cubbon Park and Majestic Metro stations, some already home to interesting works of art. This includes works from the &lsquo;Art in Transit&rsquo; project.<br /><br />&ldquo;We started off in the Peenya station in 2014,&rdquo; says Arzu Mistry, project facilitator and faculty at Srishti. Now, the students have moved on to work in the Cubbon Park station as well. <br /><br />&ldquo;In addition to the St+Art Festival, we&rsquo;re also collaborating with a lot of other groups for our project,&rdquo; she adds. &ldquo;The idea is to create meaningful artistic interventions and discourse in places of transience.&rdquo;<br /><br />Jaaga DNA, the design arm of the&nbsp; Jaaga startup, has also been working towards a similar end for close to six years now. About four years ago, it even organised the Urban Avant Garde, a festival that brought together Indian and German street artists to work in the city&rsquo;s public spaces. More recently, the organisation has discovered a new canvas in the pillars under flyovers. <br /><br />&ldquo;We have adopted seven flyovers in all,&rdquo; says Kamya Ramachandran, director of Jaaga DNA.<br />The most talked about of these is, perhaps, the Richmond flyover, it&rsquo;s pillars sporting playful black silhouettes against a yellow background. &ldquo;We had people who live and work around there stand for us as we mapped out their shadows,&rdquo; she recounts. &ldquo;The security guard of a nearby building, a chef at a Chinese restaurant who was taking a break, a passer-by walking his dog...They were all thrilled.&rdquo;<br /><br />Community involvement has helped the project in more ways than one: it has got people to sit up and take notice as well as feel a sense of ownership. So when posters &mdash; the bane of most city walls &mdash; came up along the stretch, people alerted Jaaga of it. <br /><br />&ldquo;One professor from St Joseph&rsquo;s College and a group of his students even went ahead and pulled them off,&rdquo; she recalls.<br /><br />While some artists and groups collaborate to engage the community in dialogue, Baadal Nanjundaswamy, artist and art director, seeks to use his works to draw attention to civic problems. His installations are less permanent, usually centred on potholes, manholes and the like, and have to be done away with for the spotfix he intends to bring about.<br /><br />&ldquo;Nevertheless, these too make it to the global platform through digital means &mdash; photographs circulated across the internet,&rdquo; Akshath points out. &ldquo;And it's thanks to this that street art is picking up.&rdquo;<br /><br />Baadal and Arzu disagree; they feel that the definition of street art varies depending on people&rsquo;s perception. &ldquo;Art in public spaces has always been there, in every era, every city and every village,\" says Arzu, while Baadal adds that some of it could be fairly unintentional. &ldquo;This, very often, can be comical. Imagine all these city walls painted by the BBMP, with pictures of animals, and among them, monkeys. Next to it, a notice saying people who stick bills on the wall will be fined. It's signed off with &lsquo;the municipal corporation authorities&rsquo;, and the text appears right next to the monkeys, looking like a caption of sorts. It's everywhere, you just have to be able to see it.&rdquo;<br /><br />Ullas Hydoor, one of the creators of the graffiti near Hard Rock Cafe, believes that the city is indeed becoming a more happening place for street art. &ldquo;It's getting better, but we still have a long way to go,&rdquo; he offers. <br /><br />&ldquo;I've been trying to organise jams, but only four out of eight have been successful so far. No one turned up for the rest,&rdquo; he adds.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/art1476257702765.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baabc5ecbc9256e95c1763","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"street art"},{"text":"groups"},{"text":"festivals"},{"text":"st+art festival"},{"text":"st+art india foundation"},{"text":"asian paints"},{"text":"srishti school of art and design's art in transit"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/575235/art-matter.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-12T07:35:14.399Z","udate":"2016-10-12T09:16:45.658Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-12T09:16:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fde7b200eec80f78b1fa34","id":"57fde7b200eec80f78b1fa32","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out9664.mp3","tagsForSearch":"street art,groups,festivals,st+art festival,st+art india foundation,asian paints,srishti school of art and design's art in transit","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

It's a limitation you put on your mind.&rdquo; <br /></strong><br />Proving this are many who have touched middle-age and know that being fit is the key to living a healthy life.<br /><br />Aabharna, assistant professor at Mount Carmel College, makes sure to hit the gym&nbsp;regularly, despite other commitments. She teaches health psychology.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been inclined towards fitness since I was in class five. I have always followed an exercise routine of some sort. In addition to physical fitness, I also focus on being mentally fit,&rdquo; she says. <br /><br />She goes for aerobics sessions, where she has spotted others past the <br />35-year mark. Exercise, according to her, is a stress buster and everyone, not merely the young, seem to be realising that. &ldquo;Thanks to the subject I teach, I know that food and exercise are the two most essential things in life. I don&rsquo;t hit the gym because I want to lose weight, but because it keeps me going throughout the day,&rdquo; she adds. <br /><br />However busy we may be, it is important to take time out to do what keeps us healthy. In Milind Soman we can see one of the best examples of this. The 50-year-old former supermodel takes part in many a marathon and has an enviable physique for someone his age. Most recently, he completed the &lsquo;Ironman Triathlon&rsquo; in Zurich. He has, at every step, redefined fitness. <br /><br />Arpita Nagaraja, a 27-year-old runner, says it&rsquo;s never too late to start exercising. &ldquo;When I was 12, I started running marathons. I was also into track and field sports,&rdquo; she adds. This took a backseat when she went to engineering college, but she resumed soon afterwards.<br />She opines that physical fitness also contributes to mental awareness and health. &ldquo;It helps people multi-task and also gives them a positive outlook,&rdquo; she explains.<br /><br />Shamally Chopra, a Pilates instructor who runs the studio &lsquo;Core Pilates&rsquo;, says, &ldquo;Thirty minutes&rsquo; workout every day (where one gets one cheat day a week) is essential. One can set aside three days for cardio and the other three for muscle strengthening. My customers are aged between 11&nbsp; and 72 years. Each one of them is extremely determined and fit,&rdquo; says Shamally. <br /><br />She reiterates, &ldquo;Age is a state of mind. Yes, one can&rsquo;t stop aging, but that doesn&rsquo;t prevent them from keeping up the level of physical activity they have had so far. The elderly bunch that come to my classes are committed. I see in them a sense of realisation &mdash; to take care of their body, diet and lifestyle. The older one gets, the better one understands the importance of exercise,&rdquo; Shamally observes.<br /><br />What inspires this? &ldquo;Their desire to travel. Some are already well-travelled. The idea is, the fitter they are, the better they can kick-start a new travel diary. Many go bungee jumping or journey to the Northern lights. ,&rdquo; says Shamally. <br /><br />That said, she adds that some exercises, like running which wears out the knee joints, are best avoided as one ages. A mix of flexibility and strength training, like yoga, might make for <br />a more advisable regime.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/fitnesss1476258550235.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf9a2ea63af2cd0d81d6b","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"jackie joyner-kersee"},{"text":"healthy life"},{"text":"fit"},{"text":"gym"},{"text":"fitness"},{"text":"physique"},{"text":"food"},{"text":"exercise"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/575220/on-fitness-path.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-12T07:49:21.679Z","udate":"2016-10-12T09:11:35.630Z","expirydate":"2016-12-31T07:48:48.086Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-12T09:11:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fdeb01f0b8064697ceaca4","id":"57fdeb01f0b8064697ceaca2","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out3920.mp3","tagsForSearch":"jackie joyner-kersee,healthy life,fit,gym,fitness,physique,food,exercise","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

It helps in opening the pores, loosening up blocked oil and dirt that cause whiteheads, blackheads, painful red breakouts and blemishes.

Those with oily skin complain that the skin feels dry after washing, but becomes oily, or gets eruptions, when creams and moisturisers are applied.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They wonder how to tackle dryness without getting pimples. Actually, oily skins can also be short of moisture during winter, which affects the outermost layer of the skin. Some areas of the skin may also acquire tiny white flakes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The skin absorbs moisture in the form of an emulsion of oil and water. It cannot absorb either water or oil by itself. Therefore, the only way of protecting the skin from moisture loss is to use moisturisers daily, to replenish the loss of moisture and keep the skin soft and moist.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moisturisers are available in both liquid and cream forms. During the dry season, for normal to dry skin, it is better to use a creamy moisturiser, applying it after cleansing and toning the skin. For a dry skin, a moisturiser should also be applied under make-up. A liquid moisturiser may be adequate during the humid season.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Use a cleansing milk to cleanse the skin morning and night. Apply it on the face and wipe off with moist cotton wool. Apply a light moisturising lotion if there is dryness. Add a drop or two of water before application, to provide lighter coverage. Or, mix one teaspoon pure glycerin with 100 ml rose water.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Keep it in an airtight jar in the fridge. Use a little of this lotion after cleansing. This moisturises the skin, without making it oily. Apply honey on the face daily for 10 minutes and wash off with water. If you have an aloe vera plant at home, the gel, found in the inner portion of the leaves, can be applied on the face to moisturise it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Here are some home remedies</em></strong><br />Honey is a powerful humectant (i.e. it attracts moisture to the skin). For oily skin, mix honey with egg white or lemon juice and apply on the skin daily, washing it off after 15 minutes with plain water. Both lemon juice and egg white have cleansing effects, reducing oiliness, while honey softens and nourishes the skin.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have a combination skin, apply honey by itself on the entire face, as it would suit both oily and dry areas. For dry skin, add egg yolk or a little almond oil to honey and apply on the face. Wash it off after 15 minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Avocado is a powerful moisturiser and also nourishes the skin. Avocado pulp can be mixed with yogurt and honey and applied on the skin to make it soft, smooth and glowing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Take one peeled and cored apple and puree it in a blender. Add one tablespoon honey. Apply this on the face like a mask and keep it on for 15 minutes. Then, rinse off with cool water. This is a powerful skin-toner for all skin types.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mix half a teaspoon honey, one teaspoon rose water and one teaspoon dried milk powder. Mix into a paste and apply on the face. Remove after 20 minutes with water.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/skin1476261085744.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf57b58d3f458eaf44895","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"dry skin"},{"text":"oily skin"},{"text":"dryness"},{"text":"pimples"},{"text":"moisture"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Beauty/2016-10-08/New-season-new-worries-/257841","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-12T08:31:36.897Z","udate":"2016-10-12T09:11:35.630Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-12T09:11:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fdf4e8f4a3494423c66660","id":"57fdf4e8f4a3494423c6665e","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out2750.mp3","tagsForSearch":"dry skin,oily skin,dryness,pimples,moisture","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

From moisturising your damp skin to keeping yourself hydrated can make your life easy during cold season, says an expert. Rashmi Shetty, an aesthetic physician and a renowned dermatologist, shares precise solutions to ride out the ill-effects of the impending winter.&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Stay hydrated</em></strong><br />The cold doesn't only dry out your skin, it attacks from within. Drink lots of water to keep your skin hydrated and healthy as it wards off all the toxins out of the system.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Exfoliate regularly</em></strong><br />Use a scrub made of curd and sugar to gently exfoliate your body and remove the layer of dead cells formed on it.&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Curd is known as a wonderful exfoliator for the skin due to the presence of lactic acid that provides soothing and hydrating effect to the skin, making it supple and nourished. Sugar, on the other hand, is a natural source of glycolic acid that penetrates the skin and breaks down the 'glue' that bonds skin cells.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Moisturise damp skin</em></strong><br />The key to glowing skin is moisturising from head to toe. Extra care and conditioning can help your skin brave the chill.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Hair removal</em></strong><br />Waxing and use of creams are a complete no-no. Waxing is time-consuming as well as messy. On the contrary, shaving when done right is favoured and faster.

It makes skin more susceptible to dryness and peeling.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Use a good sunscreen</em></strong><br />During winters, most of us love basking in the mild heat of the sun to beat the chills.

{"_id":"57fdf9fd4c7cd95f38e90f8e","title":"Toward A New Literacy -","subtitle":"The magazine for people who enjoy good writing!","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dear Reader,<br />As I was describing <em>Rosebud</em>, recently, to a friend who had not yet read it, I was asked, \"So, how is <em>Rosebud</em>different from other literary magazines?\"<br /><br />This got me to thinking about the mess literary magazines have been in since the days when I worked on my first small press literary magazine in 1966. The conventional wisdom has always been that short stories and poetry are not commercially viable. As a result, book publishers have been reluctant to publish serious literary efforts in these areas, and have failed to promote them when they did. Thus, the burden and potential reward of publishing short fiction and poetry has often fallen into the hands of subsidized university publishers (who on the whole have done a miserable job) and a few determined individuals who dip heavily into their own personal resources, financial and otherwise, to bring neglected writers and works to the attention of a slightly larger audience than they had enjoyed before.<br /><br />As a freelancer for many years I found this situation daunting. A short news piece of mine, for say, National Public Radio, would find millions of listeners coast to coast -- but an experimental verse play that had taken years to write was experienced only by a few hundred people. Of course no one expects to earn a living at poetry and short fiction, and the way the culture is going, it will never be a road to fame and fortune either. Nevertheless, I know there are many fine writers out there whose lights are never seen. I see their manuscripts every week, more than even<em>Rosebud</em> could ever publish, work that deserves a greater audience than the shadows of a dark file cabinet.<br /><br />Looking out at the market I find that the courageous little magazines who struggle to keep the fresh and independent spirit of American literature alive find themselves constantly at the brink of exhaustion and bankruptcy, while university publications publish work that is arch, bloodless, contrived, and often - simply bad.<br /><br />Being bad of course, is part of the price of taking risks, and can even be invigorating and refreshing if it is done with imagination, but my feeling is that many \"successful\" literary magazines, having established a loyal following, take almost no risks at all, publishing work that has exactly the same tone and flavor over and over in order to maintain their established recipe for survival. As a matter of fact, \"good work\" has come to mean only work that takes no risks and strikes the \"high tone\" of the rest of the publication. The result is a plethora of literary publications that are more concerned with being taken seriously by their peers and other \"literati\" than with publishing serious work.<br /><br />This is a hard facade to challenge. Some of <em>Rosebud's</em> competitors are magazines that project an aura of \"exclusivity\" (i.e., buy our magazine and maybe you can be one of \"us\"). They are filled with pet professors, National Endowment recipients, and prize winners whose works (sometimes good, sometimes not) are published because of who they are, not what they have written. Implicit seems to be the idea that the rest of us have nothing to say, and are not worth the investment in ink.<br /><br />Of course, lots of us aren't very good. A river of bad work, written with serious and earnest intent, passes over my desk every day. At the same time, we receive more fine work than we can ever put in print, and it horrifies me to wonder what part of our literary heritage we lose daily, for all time. Even in the most humble submissions, I see a hunger for expression in language, the desire to push words out and pull them in. Even, ironically, on the internet these days, I see creative interaction in words blossoming in a way that the publishing culture has stultified.<br /><br />In this energy is the seed of a new American voice struggling to articulate itself, and make itself heard in spite of all the proprietary claims upon its possession and stewardship. In this new American voice which I find in every envelope I open is a hunger for a literary culture which is neither exclusive nor simplistic, whose sophistication rises from what is written, not from those committees who render opinions as to what is good, and what is not. A voice which has a genuine chance to evolve and improve itself on the basis of hearing and being heard. A voice which will be equally cautious of adulation and venomous critiques. A literature based on the spiritual and literary principles of Walt Whitman's <em>Leaves of Grass.</em> It is <em>Rosebud's</em> purpose to respond to this need.<br /><br />Sincerely,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Roderick Clark<br />Editor</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/rosebud_magazine1476262388658.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"rosebud"},{"text":"magazine"},{"text":"english"},{"text":"literature"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57fb6fc4e66f216b816f52ca","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.rsbd.net/NEW/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1&Itemid=18","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-12T08:53:17.064Z","udate":"2016-10-13T12:11:23.117Z","expirydate":"2017-01-01T08:47:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-12T08:47:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fdf9fd4c7cd95f38e90f90","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out9885.mp3","tagsForSearch":"rosebud,magazine,english,literature","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Sedentary lifestyle causes osteoporosis among men and women; it progresses silently without symptoms until a fracture occurs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not getting enough exercise, working for longer hours on computer, high work pressure can be some of the reasons for the occurrence of the disorder.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">People nowadays, lose out on healthy living during their peak years and do not get to bank calcium and bone density, leading to weak bones after 40, when the process of bone-building slows and wear and tear increases on the bony surfaces.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here are the habits that can significantly elevate your risks and tips to how to minimise the risks involved.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Food</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Eating disorders are illnesses characterised by unhealthy behaviors associated with food or eating, such as starving, overeating, or bingeing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many eat a moderate amount of food; a few would subsist mostly on fast foods, cookies and other high-sugar dishes. Nutrition is very critical to bone growth and improper diet may badly ruin the bones. Hence, it is crucial to keep in mind of what one is consuming.</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Monitor the intake of calcium and vitamin D intake. Calcium helps build and maintain bone and vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium. You can get calcium from foods, supplements, or a combination of the two.</li>\n<li>Women above 50 years must consume about 1,500 mg of calcium daily, which is comparable to four glasses of fortified milk each day.</li>\n<li>High protein level may cause more calcium to be excreted through your urine.</li>\n<li>Fruits and vegetable, on the other hand, will increase your magnesium and potassium intake, which help to build up calcium stores.</li>\n<li>Eat enough vegetables and get about 1500 mg of calcium a day, if you prefer to have high-protein diet</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Sedentary lifestyle</em></strong><br />With more and more people spending time sitting at office, there is a rising need for physical activity among the urban youth. It is important to find time for physical exercise.

This makes them prone to developing weaker bones and higher chances of fracturing.&nbsp;</div>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Those affected by osteoporosis need to follow a low impact workout routine recommended by their doctor. Bones need resistance to grow strong, which is why weight-bearing exercises are not only good for your muscles, but also your bones.</li>\n<li>Taking a walk every day or going to the gym daily should be part of everyone&rsquo;s daily routine as it keeps the body active and helps build stronger bones.</li>\n<li>Weight-bearing exercise like walking or jogging and low-impact aerobics like elliptical training or biking can be beneficial.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Alcohol consumption and smoking</em></strong><br />Alcohol and smoking negatively impacts bone health for several reasons. To begin with, excessive alcohol and smoke interferes with the balance of calcium, an essential nutrient for healthy bones.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It also increases parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, which in turn reduce the body&rsquo;s calcium reserves. Some studies have shown a direct relationship between tobacco use and decreased bone density. Chronic heavy drinking can cause hormone deficiencies in men and women.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Cutting down on the amount of alcohol that is consumed as opposed to giving up alcohol completely can help bring lots of health benefits, and can be significantly easier to sustain.</li>\n<li>It&rsquo;s best to limit alcohol consumption to two drinks per day.

His multifarious and dynamic personality was based on truth and nothing but the truth. Non &ndash; violence was another intrinsic element of this philosophy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At the All India Congress Committee meeting in Bombay on 8th August&nbsp;1942, that is, on the eve of Quit India Movement, Mahatma Gandhi declared, &ldquo;I want to live full span of my life and according to me, the full span of life is 125 years. By that time, India will not only be free but the whole world will be free. Today, I do not believe that Englishmen are free, I do not believe that Americans are free. They are free to do what? To hold the&nbsp;other part of humanity in bondage? Are they fighting for their liberty? I am not arrogant. I am not a proud man. I know the distinction between pride, arrogance, insolence and so on. But what I am saying is, I believe, in the voice of God. It is the fundamental truth that I am telling you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gandhi was the most normal of men. He was universal. Such a man cannot be measured, weighed, or estimated. He is the measure of all things. Gandhi was not a philosopher, nor a politician. He was a humble seeker of truth. Truth unites because it can be only one. You can cut a man&rsquo;s head, but not his thoughts. Non &ndash; violence is the only other aspect of the sterling coin of truth. Non &ndash; violence is love, the very content of life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In this principle of non&ndash;violence, Gandhi introduced the&nbsp;technique of resistance to evil and untruth. His Satyagraha is inspired by boundless love and compassion. It is opposed to sin, not sinner, the evil, not the&nbsp;evil doer. For him the&nbsp;truth was God and in that sense, he was the&nbsp;man of God. The truth is not yours or mine. It is neither Western nor Eastern.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gandhi&rsquo;s prayer stands for invoking the inner strength of men for the good of one another, his spinning wheel for the dignity of productive labour, and broomstick for the&nbsp;abolition of social inequalities based on birth. He wanted freedom from the&nbsp;rule of merchandise. He wanted rationality in</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He wanted freedom from the&nbsp;rule of merchandise. He wanted rationality in the productive system, which should be based on human rationality. He was not an orthodox economist. His plan was peace, security, and progress for the&nbsp;human race as a whole.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He believed that the planning should be based on &lsquo;Man Power&rsquo; rather than horsepower. These issues are not restricted to India&nbsp;but are global in nature. These principles are universal. He insisted on the&nbsp;individual code of conduct. He introduced an entirely new dimension in the&nbsp;technique of social transformation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One cannot comprehend Satyagraha without connecting it with Constructive Work or the Ashram observances. Gandhi, the statesman and the fighter for freedom, could not have been like what he was, had he not been Gandhi, the social reformer, and Gandhi, the saint. It is the quest for truth in all its glory that creates Gandhi, the man.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gandhi never pretended to be consistent with previously held views in his life. He readily abandoned his stands when he felt the need to do so. These &ldquo;inconsistencies&rdquo; often infuriated his antagonists, who felt that he was a &ldquo;slippery&rdquo; politician. I think his inconsistencies were more a reflection of an ever &ndash; growing personality to whom consistency was less important than being true to the inner voice of truth as understood at any given point of time.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gandhiji took up the ancient but powerful idea of ahimsa or nonviolence and made it familiar throughout the world, particularly in the&nbsp;political and economic field. However, non&ndash;violence means more than the mere absence of violence. It is something more positive, more meaningful and dynamic and Gandhiji combined it with a sense of responsibility for the welfare of people. His great achievement was to demonstrate through his own example that nonviolence can be implemented effectively not only in the political arena&nbsp;but also in our day &ndash; to &ndash; day life. His whole life was his experiment with truth.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He knew that human dignity cannot be preserved on charity. Mutuality and well &ndash; being is the essence of life. It is, therefore, S+G that is &ldquo;Science plus Gandhi&rdquo;, which alone can save a planet earth. Gandhi was an apostle of peace and brotherhood. The modern nuclear weapons, not only pose a grave threat to world peace but will destroy mother earth. Apart from the ecologically sustainable model of development preached by Gandhi decentralization of socio&ndash;economic power based on non&ndash;violence, and building up of people&rsquo;s power, communal harmony based on people&rsquo;s initiative, rather than the state power is the only alternative.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The 20th century was the most violent period in human history. More people have suffered and have been killed by organized violence than any other time before. The wars, the genocides, the weapons of mass destruction have created such an enormous mass misery and agony that it is difficult to find any trace of hope. Therefore, Gandhi&rsquo;s teachings of non&ndash;violence are most relevant today. Now, though late, there is a realization that there is no other alternative. This is the reason why amidst report of increasing teenage violence across the United States, a bill have been introduced in New Jersey Assembly seeking to include Mahatma Gandhi&rsquo;s teachings of non&ndash;violence in the school curriculum. On 12th May 2000, on Mother&rsquo;s Day in New York, several thousand mothers resolved and demanded a ban on the manufacture of the&nbsp;arms&nbsp;and its use. Therefore, in my view, the teachings of Gandhi are not only relevant but also the only alternative.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some people seem to think that compassion or non-violence is just a passive emotional response, rather than a rational stimulus to action. They forget that Gandhi combined it with a sense of responsibility. He was not a mere onlooker but was an active participant. He first followed and then preached. He was a leader in the&nbsp;real sense of the said term. Whenever there was a risk to the&nbsp;life he was at the forefront and never had a desire for power or wealth. Sacrifice was the&nbsp;keyword of his life. He lived a simple need-based life because he knew that needs have an end whereas greed is endless. Gandhiji knew that &ldquo;In times to come people will not judge us by the creed we follow or label we wear, or the slogans we shout, but by our work, industry, sacrifice, honesty and purity of character.&rdquo; He also knew that man who wants freedom has to take a&nbsp;tremendous risk. That was the essence of his life. That is why he could say that &ldquo;My Life is My Message&rdquo;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>(The author, formerly the Acting Chief Justice of Bombay High Court, is currently the Chairman, Institute of Gandhian Studies, Wardha and Gandhi Research Foundation, Jalgaon.

{"_id":"57fe1547f0b8064697ceae20","title":"Yuko Shimizu talks about hitting rock bottom","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fceea63af2cd0d814ce","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I remember staying back in class once to do my homework and realising that there were some apples that had been placed there for still life painting. I was so poor that I thought, 'Oh, free apples!' and took them home. Half of them turned out to be rotten because they had been sitting in class for so long.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That's Yuko Shimizu recalling her time as a 30-something student in a class of 18-year-olds at Manhattan's School of Visual Arts. She had traded her cushy job in corporate PR in Tokyo, forgoing the disposable income that allowed her to \"go on vacation, eat at restaurants and buy stuff\" in order to \"pursue a childhood dream\" -- even if it meant being \"really, really stingy\" to keep living costs low, sharing an apartment with girls half her age and waking up in the middle of the night feeling miserable.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"When I hit rock bottom, I would think that I am at least doing what I wanted to do,\" says the Japanese illustrator, now 48. \"It was difficult&hellip; I couldn't make up my mind about pursuing art until a terrible boss came along and precipitated the decision. But if I hadn't gone to New York, I would've regretted it the rest of my life.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Yes to ambition, no to airs</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Drawing and painting, which she started doing as a two-year-old toddler, is gratifying. \"It's really important to have something in the hardest of times that makes life better. That sums up illustration for me,\" Shimizu, who was in Jaipur last week for the Zee Kyoorius Designyatra, says. \"Creating pictures gives me satisfaction so that even if someone looks at it for a second and it makes them happy or makes them stop and think, there is meaning in that.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Her illustrations have graced the covers and pages of <em>Time, The New Yorker, The New York Times, Rolling Stone, Businessweek </em>and <em>Fortune</em>and the publicity material for brands such as Microsoft, Nike, Pepsi, T-Mobile as well as books, including <em>Tales on Tweet</em>. And it doesn't bother her if her work is printed on diapers, ensuring that babies \"poop in her art\". \"Illustrators create something that is disposable,\" she told a packed hall at the Zee Kyoorius Designyatra. \"At some point, our creation is very important and at some point, it's discarded. That's alright... you move on. It keeps illustrators down to earth.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While her namesake was the creator of Hello Kitty, Shimizu has been selected as one of '100 Japanese People The World Respects' (by<em>Newsweek </em>Japan in 2009). She remains unabashedly modest in her 18-year-career as an illustrator which has seen her win several awards, including a D&amp;AD Yellow Pencil. She talks about being complacent, being driven to frustration and having worries with the same ease with which she discusses clients and getting inspiration for her Japanese aesthetic-meets-comic-strip style of illustration &mdash; all laced with zest and humour.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It's easy to fall into the trap of work-for-free-because-you-get-exposure when you are starting out,\" she said in Jaipur. \"Don't do that! I say this because there are a lot of mistakes &mdash; and there are many you should make and learn from &mdash; that others have made for you... as I have. So learn from them.\" But she lays emphasis on being extremely ambitious and putting in hard work. \"If you keep your goals low, chances are you will get there quickly and become lazy. So keep your ambition really, really high, and perhaps you may not reach the top, but that's okay, it'll keep you going.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Paying it forward</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While not religious, Shimizu whole heartedly endorses karma. Recalling how her peers would recommend her for work when she embarked on a career as an illustrator, she stresses on the need to pay it forward. \"If I have to turn down a job, I always recommend other illustrators, and especially newcomers,\" says Shimizu, who spends her Sunday afternoons taking Bruiser, her Chihuahua, for a walk. \"It makes the industry a lot happier and healthier. And that's good karma points.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Yuko's mantra for illustrators</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">New York-based Japanese illustrator Yuko Shimizu says illustrators don't just make pretty pictures. \"They are problem solvers,\" she says. \"For instance, if I have to design a cover for a book, I have to read the book and understand it and turn it into a single visual for the cover. Or if I'm illustrating for an article about politics, I have to read about it and then come up with a meaningful idea. And coming up with ideas is problem solving.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1) Add 5-10% 'new' in your work &mdash; something you've never tried before. You'll have a sense of accomplishment and keep learning.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2) For illustrators to be relevant, they have to do something that is better than, or offers more than, photographs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3) Keep your ambition really, really high and work hard towards it. Remind yourself about this when you feel lazy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4) Don't take work that you believe is unethical and will give you sleepless nights.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5) It's okay to turn down a job. There'll always be someone else to do it (But if you do turn it down, recommend others who can take it on and pay it forward).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">6) If you've agreed to do a job, put 100 per cent into it. And give options.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">7) Don't fall for work-for-free-to-get-exposure when you are starting out.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">8) If you do work free, you should get total freedom. Free work = total creative freedom.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">9) Experiment with your style.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">10) If you are frustrated, you can b**** to your friends. But if the f****d up thing doesn't go away, then do something about it.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/508565-yuko-shimizu-facebook1476269368391.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57bab874ecbc9256e95c1835","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"illustrator"},{"text":"yuko shimizu"},{"text":"art"},{"text":"visual arts"},{"text":"painting"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-collecting-karma-points-2262532","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-12T10:49:43.685Z","udate":"2016-10-13T05:39:46.178Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-12T10:49:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57fe1547f0b8064697ceae22","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out5923.mp3","tagsForSearch":"illustrator,yuko shimizu,art,visual arts,painting","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

This helps to connect muscle and bone tissue to each other and increase bone density. Dark beer in particular, with its&nbsp;high hop content,&nbsp;contains silicon. So, moderate consumption of dark beer can certainly help prevent osteoporosis.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Beer can improve&nbsp;cholesterol levels</strong><br />&nbsp;Scientists&nbsp;have found that beer consumption contributes to increasing&nbsp;the proportion of healthy HDL cholesterol in the body. Two beers a day can have a positive effect on cholesterol levels.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;Beer can&nbsp;reduce cardiovascular risks</strong><br />According to Harvard University, more than 100 studies have found an association between moderate beer consumption and reduced risk of heart attack&nbsp;by 25 to 40 percent. So, if you want to do your heart some&nbsp;good, treat yourself to&nbsp;a nice, cold beer with dinner every now and then.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Beer can reduce the risk of diabetes</strong><br />In comparative studies, a relationship between moderate alcohol consumption and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes was found. American researchers found that of those who drank 1-4 10 oz&nbsp;beers&nbsp;per day, the risk of getting&nbsp;this disease was&nbsp;lower.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5. Beer can prevent kidney stones</strong><br />You wouldn't wish&nbsp;kidney stones on your worst enemy.

Aloe Vera &amp; Apple Cider Vinegar Fasts</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While these two herbal remedies act together primarily as a means to cleanse the colon, thereby eliminating toxins which could accumulate in the digestive tract causing disease, they are also&nbsp;great anti-inflammatory agents.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The benefits of Apple Cider Vinegar&nbsp;(ACV) cannot be understated.&nbsp;It helps with candida overgrowth (also shown to contribute to many cancers) and&nbsp;lowers blood glucose levels. Aloe Vera juice has been shown to help people who have tried numerous pharmaceutical meds &ndash; folfox, xeloda, avastin and other chemotherapies to no avail.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>6. Ginger Root</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An Ayurvedic staple, ginger is used in many Indian dishes.&nbsp;Inflammation markers that have been earlier proved in clinical research as&nbsp;precursors to colon cancer&nbsp;can be reduced significantly by the consumption of ginger powder or ginger roots. A powerful anti-inflammatory, ginger soothes and heals the digestive tract, and therefore has been suggested as one of the best home remedies for the treatment of colon cancer.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>7. Turmeric</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you haven&rsquo;t heard of this herb by now, you&rsquo;ve likely been living under a rock. The compounds in Turmeric can heal just about anything. Curcumins found in turmeric roots cause&nbsp;colon cancer cells to self-destruct. Astounding results were found when testing turmeric&rsquo;s ability to destroy cancer cells at&nbsp;the Department of Surgery, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sure, you can turn to chemotherapy for your colon cancer, which causes your hair to fall out, your insides to feel like they won&rsquo;t stop being regurgitated, and your energy to be completely devastated. You can also try invasive surgery &ndash; all for the bargain basement price of several to twenty thousand dollars.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/cancer31476334858506.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57932d2941ed8be8781be10c","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"herbs"},{"text":"ayurveda"},{"text":"cancers"},{"text":"ashwagandha"},{"text":"garlic"},{"text":"green tea"},{"text":"celandine"},{"text":"herbal"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://english.annnews.in/english/health/news/7-herbs-used-in-ayurveda-that-destroy-colon-other-cancers-fast","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-13T05:01:12.566Z","udate":"2017-01-12T07:34:17.872Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-13T04:58:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57ff1518c87f523c37223543","publishedBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out3215.mp3","audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"herbs,ayurveda,cancers,ashwagandha,garlic,green tea,celandine,herbal"}

{"_id":"57ff18a8b255354bb8e304e3","title":"Cashew Nut Benefits from Heart Health to Gorgeous Hair","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e65af76df6bbfd6adf3","content":"<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 news-content no-left-gutters margin-top-15\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A popular ingredient finding its way into many Indian gravies, cashew - a plant originating from Brazil, is a nut high in minerals. Brought to India by traders, the cashew tree grows up to exceptional heights having a rather irregular trunk. Hanging from the branches are large juicy apples at the bottom of which are attached the cashew nut. Made available round the year, the nut has a great shelf life if stored properly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The nut and the fruit, both have multiple uses. The nut, often known as the poor man&rsquo;s plantation although now it is sold for steep prices, is used to make delectable and rich curries and also roasted and eaten dry. Back when nomads had no idea how to consume the fruit, the nut was discarded while the fruit was given more importance. Contrary to the popular belief that it can make you gain fat, a considerable amount of cashews in your diet can provide you with many health benefits -</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Heart Health</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) in its case study points out that nuts are likely to be beneficial for health, keeping a check on various ailments, such as heart disease.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Studies consistently show that nut intake has a cholesterol-lowering effect, in the context of healthy diets, and there is emerging evidence of beneficial effects on oxidative stress, inflammation, and vascular reactivity. Cashews help lower LDL and increase the carrying capacity for HDL. HDL is responsible to absorb the cholesterol from the heart and take it to the liver where it can be broken down.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In 2003, the Food and Drug Administration had stated that a fistful of nuts a day as part of a low-fat diet may reduce the risk of heart disease. The heart association recommends four servings of unsalted, unoiled nuts a week and warns against eating too many, since they are dense in calories. Another study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), also establishes a significant association between the consumption of nuts and a lower incidence of death due to heart diseases, cancer and respiratory diseases. The study stated that nutrients in nuts, such as unsaturated fatty acids, protein, fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants may confer heart-protective, anti-carcinogenic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Prevents Blood Disease</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The consumption of cashews on a regular basis and limited manner may help in avoiding blood diseases. Cashew nuts are rich in copper, which plays an important role in the elimination of free radicals from the body. Copper deficiency can lead to iron deficiencies such as anemia. Hence our diet should contain recommended quantity of copper. And cashew nuts are a good source.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Protects the Eye</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the urban environment matched with its excessive pollution, our eyes often suffer from various infections. Cashews contains a powerful antioxidant pigment called Zea Xanthin. This pigment is readily and directly absorbed by our retina, says nutritionist Anju Sood. This then forms a protective layer over our retina which prevents the harmful UV rays. Dr Anshul Jaibahrat Bhatnagar says small quantities of Zea Xanthin helps prevent age related macular degeneration in elderly and hence helps maintain eyehealth.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. Good for the Skin</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Derived from the cashew seeds, &ldquo;cashew oil does wonders for your skin,&rdquo; says Gargi Sharma, Manager Weight Management, Aayna. Cashew nut oil is rich in selenium, zinc, magnesium, iron and phosphorous. Also, they are great sources of phytochemicals, proteins and antioxidants. The high percentage of selenium in cashews is not only good for your skin but &ldquo;helps prevent cancer as well,&rdquo; says nutritionist Anju Sood.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5. Weight Loss</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In comparison to diets excluding the intake of nuts, people consuming nuts on a moderate and regular basis lose weight faster. Based on the evidence from epidemiological and controlled clinical studies, nut consumption is not associated with higher body weight. The study done by the Journal of Nutrition states that the epidemiological evidence indicates consistently that nut consumers have a lower BMI than non-consumers. With respect to clinical studies, the evidence is nearly uniform that their inclusion in the diet leads to little or no weight gain. Moreover, nuts like cashews are &ldquo;packed with Omega 3 fatty acids that contribute to giving a boost to the metabolic process to burn excess fat,&rdquo; says Delhi-based nutritionist Shilpa Arora. Nuts are a great snack for those who are looking to lose weight as they are nutritious and tend to keep you full for a longer time. &ldquo;Nuts should always be eaten raw and unsalted, so they are beneficial for weight loss efforts,&rdquo; adds Shilpa.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">6. Source of Dietary Fibres</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to studies, cashew nuts have a great percentage of dietary fibers. The two essential dietary fibres required by our body are, oleic acid and palmitic acid. &ldquo;These fibers are not produced by our body hence they need to be consumed externally,&rdquo; says nutritionist Anju Sood. Cashew nuts are good sources of these fibers. Dietary fibers help digest food better, however excessive consumption may cause bloating and significant intestinal gas production. Consumption of nuts like cashews have been related to decreased incidences of several digestive diseases.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">7. Healthy and Shiny hair</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Experts say that the consumption of cashews as well as the application of cashew oil on your scalp ensures healthy hair. &ldquo;Copper present in cashew nut oil helps in the production of skin and hair pigment called melanin,&rdquo; says nutritionist Gargi Sharma. It also enhances hair colour and can provide a silky-smooth texture due to the presence of linoleic and oleic acids.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/Cashew-Nut-1476335770892.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57932d2941ed8be8781be10c","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"cashew nut"},{"text":"heart health"},{"text":"gorgeous hair"},{"text":"cholesterol"},{"text":"fda"},{"text":"calories"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://english.annnews.in/english/food/news/cashew-nut-benefits-from-heart-health-to-gorgeous-hair","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-13T05:16:24.394Z","udate":"2016-10-13T12:50:26.832Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-13T05:16:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57ff18a8b255354bb8e304e5","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out8707.mp3","tagsForSearch":"cashew nut,heart health,gorgeous hair,cholesterol,fda,calories","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

{"_id":"57ff1cb89ea5a354b24fa19f","title":"Data on girl child status, other social indicators critically lacking in india: Study","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e2e34a4ac2d218b1a46","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">New Delhi: India is lacking data for many critical indicators of social developments-a disturbing fact which a study has brought out on the International Day of the Girl Child. And even in those areas where such data was existing, it was available after a gap of eight to ten years, which was making the government difficult to effectively intervene. Girls account for 48 per cent of India's children, yet, a girl continues to face discrimination from the womb. In order to tackle the underlying gender inequality that holds girls back, the country has to re-strategise and undertake focused investment for its girl children, says CRY(Child Rights and You).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The existing data on girl children is limited and intermittently available and does not allow for a focused and longitudinal assessment of the changing situation of the girls in our country. ''To analyse progress and revisit strategies to plan change, data forms the basis of intervention. In India, however, this planning is not as effective since data for many critical indicators is not available and for most indicators it is available at a gap of 8 to 10 years,'' says a study done by the NGO. The gap in data exists at all levels and all areas relating to the different facets of lives of girls in India. Given an example, the study says that to gauge the outcome of the host of measures undertaken under the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao scheme, annual or bi-annual data on child sex ratios is required at least in the 100 identified critical districts. However, child sex ratio data is available only once a decade from the Census survey. Similarly, data on female foeticide is extremely difficult to collect and remains under-reported. Data on maternal health and care are collected via health surveys such as National Family Health Survey (NFHS) and District level Health Survey (DLHS) which are also conducted once a decade. Unless the scheme design consciously invests in monitoring of outcomes, the effectiveness of such goals and policies aimed at reducing gender- based inequalities and various other challenges will continue to be undermined by knowledge gaps. With the Indian society's known bias in favour of male child when it comes to nourishment, possibly the biggest data gap for girl children is on their nutritional status. There is no gender-segregated data on nutritional status of children under 5 years of age, which makes it impossible to gauge the health of girls in their early childhood.

Yes latest research and studies reveal that drinking water forcibily may some times kill you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Researchers from Researchers from Monash University &nbsp;in Victoria, Australia have found a mechanism that regulates fluid intake in the human body and stops us from over-drinking. Excess of water in the body will cause the sodium levels in the blood to become abnormally low which finally leads to a condition called&nbsp; hyponatremia or Water intoxication.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Taking excess of water will give rise to symptoms like sluggishness&nbsp; and nausea to convulsions and coma. It showed that a `swallowing inhibition' is activated by the brain after excess liquid&nbsp;is consumed, helping maintain tightly calibrated volumes of water in the body.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Researchers asked the participants to drink water when they felt thirsty and drink water forcibily though they did not feel like to drink water and asked them to tell how much effort&nbsp; they had put in to drink excess water forcibly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The results showed a three-fold increase in effort when over-drinking. &ldquo;Here, for the first time, we found effortful swallowing after drinking excess water, which mean participants were having to overcome some sort of resistance.This was compatible with our notion that the swallowing reflex becomes inhibited once enough wa ter has been drunk,&ldquo; Farrell&nbsp; one of the researchers said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Researchers used functional magnetic resonance&nbsp;imaging (fMRI) to measure activity in various parts of the brain, focusing on the brief period just before swallowing. The fMRI showed the right prefrontal areas of the brain were much more active when participants were trying to swallow with effort, suggesting that the frontal cortex steps in to override the swallowing inhibition.&nbsp;</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/water1476338509338.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57fbaa65b38e1d5d6a0c4ab0","publisherSectionName":"apherald.com","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"water"},{"text":"drinking water risk"},{"text":"intoxication"},{"text":"health"},{"text":"fluid"},{"text":"human body"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.apherald.com/Health/ViewArticle/156733/Health-Drinking-too-much-of-water-may-put-you-at-risk/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-13T06:02:02.258Z","udate":"2016-10-13T07:07:26.749Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-13T06:01:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57ff235af8137e567bd8ad9a","publiseherSectionId":"57ff235af8137e567bd8ad9b","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"tagsForSearch":"water,drinking water risk,intoxication,health,fluid,human body","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

{"_id":"57ff2b0f88b8006a7219576c","title":"A primer of impressive-sounding words and their curious origins","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb900dea63af2cd0d814cf","content":"<p>Do you wonder if there is a word for the feeling of hopeless sadness you might get during your boss&rsquo;s motivational speech, or to describe the limited view (for us) of the characters in a film, how words they can reflect gender stereotypes or even what dogs have to do with bad poetry or hot days?</p>\n<p>There are such words and such links, though we might not know them. For there is one human innovation that, despite its abundant resources augmented over the ages, is seeing lesser and lesser utilisation today, even though we&rsquo;re seeing an unprecedented communication revolution, it is vocabulary. And etymology, or the studys of word origins, is a related casualty.</p>\n<p>But what relevance has vocabulary when grammar and orthography are being given the go-by? The need emerges on realisation that what works in social media or chats &ndash; won&rsquo;t take us far in the real world, and in our work. And then one appropriate word can convey much more and more unforgettably than a full sentence, and that is the essence of human communication, not crunching words for speedier messaging.</p>\n<p>But building up an adequate vocabulary is a long-term process, requiring extensive reading, if not regular dipping into some voluminous dictionary, but there are ways to shorten this route.&nbsp; Reading this book for example. In a follow-up to his popular &ldquo;How to Sound Clever&rdquo; (2010), Van Den Bergh presents another 600 or so words we must know, ranging from acedia to Zelig, from mainlining to screed, and from Pooh-Bah to valence. He however stresses that despite the unfamiliarity of some of them, they are not curiosities of the English language, but &ldquo;still managing to be common currency, and definitely not &lsquo;dead&rsquo; or obsolete&rdquo;.&nbsp; But these are not words one can just memorise and seek to use for effect without understanding their full connotation, not just the meaning or what we think is the meaning, for this could be professionally hazardous &ndash; as happened to the author himself.</p>\n<p>Van Der Bergh, who has a keen interest in language but has worked as a businessman in London for over a decade, mentioned in his first book, that he was once making a presentation for a deal and thought it went off well with the opposite side apparently satisfied. But when he ended, one of them noted he had been using one word a lot and asked him if he knew the meaning. It turned out that Van Der Bergh had been using it all wrong.</p>\n<p>The deal never happened. &ldquo;Now, that particular gentleman may have been a stickler but his point stands: if you can&rsquo;t be trusted with your use of those most elementary forms of communication, words, then what can you be trusted with exactly?&rdquo; he asks.&nbsp; Like the previous volume, he says this one too came from the &ldquo;most wonderful words&rdquo; he had come across in conversation and newspaper articles, and he not only enlists them with their meanings, but also provides examples of usage and in some cases, a small history of their chequered origins.</p>\n<p>And Van Der Bergh ensures the meaning is well brought out through the mostly witty examples of usage he comes up with. For acedia, which we learn comes from the Greek and means unaccountable melancholy, he provides the gem &ldquo;Halfway through my boss&rsquo;s motivational speech, my mind began to wander, and soon acedia took a grip of me&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Familiar to wage-slaves?&nbsp; While any reasonably-literate person would know quite a bit of the words presented, there are many more, drawn from many fields and languages, not only showcasing the richness of language, but also give a vivid view of how words evolve and change their meanings &ndash; mainly from positive to negative but also vice versa, and what dark histories may lie behind some innocuous sounding ones. As entertaining as it is educational, this also shows how languages like English retain primacy by freely appropriating more expressive words from others even they have a existing word &ndash; avatar is a recent example.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/primer1476340487771.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57fbaa65b38e1d5d6a0c4ab0","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"bloomsbury"},{"text":"information"},{"text":"hubert van den bergh"},{"text":"motivational speech"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57fb6fc4e66f216b816f52ca","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.freepressjournal.in/book-reviews/a-primer-of-impressive-sounding-words-and-their-curious-origins/932718","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-13T06:34:55.348Z","udate":"2016-10-20T12:50:07.751Z","expirydate":"2017-02-09T06:28:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-13T06:28:00.000Z","publiseherSectionId":"57ff0f0cf0b8064697ceb047","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57ff2b0f88b8006a7219576e","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"subtitle":"In a follow-up to his popular “How to Sound Clever” (2010), Van Den Bergh presents another 600 or so words we must know","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6710.mp3","audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"bloomsbury,information,hubert van den bergh,motivational speech","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

{"_id":"57ff38e933dc4323108121ff","title":"Cold, fatigue, stress? Make vitamin C a friend this fall","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e4358d3f458eaf4410d","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whether you're stressed, tired, overworked or exposed to other factors like smoking, pollution, certain medications or endurance sports, your vitamin C intake may not be sufficient for your lifestyle and needs. As fall arrives, Florence Hanczyk -- a homeopathy doctor in Paris, France, specializing in chrono nutrition -- advises taking vitamin C combined with other vitamins and minerals (E,A, zinc, selenium) to make it less toxic for the body. She also recommends sticking to a daily intake of 500 milligrams unless you have a particularly active lifestyle.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Vitamin C is an essential vitamin that the body gets from food and from dietary supplements. Unlike certain animals, the human body cannot make on its own vitamin C. Smokers, for example, have a greater need for vitamin C, and should make sure they're getting enough every day. Moreover, an acidifying diet of the \"steak-fries-coffee-cigarettes\" kind inevitably leads to vitamin C deficiency, which can cause fatigue, increased risk of infection and poor sleep. Being tired for no reason, having cold after cold from fall to spring, gums that bleed when brushing teeth, skin that marks easily with bruises at the slightest bump, and allergies that flare up intensely and more frequently, can all be warning signs of vitamin C deficiency.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A 2013 study found no significant difference in terms of absorption between so-called \"synthetic\" vitamin C and natural forms of vitamin C such as acerola -- a small red fruit native to South America and widely available in tablet form. It's important to check a product's composition and avoid those that contain additives and sweeteners, as they can disrupt sleep. Synthetic vitamin C is much cheaper to produce than natural vitamins, making it more affordable to buy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why are vitamin C supplements needed on top of dietary intake?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It all depends on your needs. A diet including plenty of fresh, seasonal fruit (oranges, kiwis, lemons, guavas, blackcurrants) and vegetables can be sufficient for some people but not for others. Freshly harvested, ripe and seasonal fruit isn't always readily available. Nutrient levels are highest when fruit is ripe, but they drop with storage time. On the other hand, anyone who is stressed, overworked, lives in a city or a polluted environment, is a smoker or lives with smokers, or who takes certain medications or exercises regularly -- particularly endurance sports -- will have vitamin C requirements that exceed their intake.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What's the right dosage?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is better to be cautious with vitamin C and avoid taking the vitamin alone in high doses for prolonged periods of time. This antioxidant vitamin can become harmful in the presence of other antioxidants, due to complex biochemical mechanisms. It's best to look for a supplement that combines vitamin C with vitamins E, A, zinc and selenium, always in moderate doses for a regular treatment, with a maximum 500 milligrams per day for sedentary lifestyles or one gram per day for keen exercisers. It is the combination of these vitamins and minerals that will ensure the desired effect. For a shock treatment, when you have a cold for example, try taking two grams of vitamin C three times a day for a short period of time (between one and three days) then drop back to between 500 and 1,000 milligrams.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/cold1476344028149.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57bab874ecbc9256e95c1835","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"colds"},{"text":"fatigue"},{"text":"stress"},{"text":"vitamin c"},{"text":"smoking"},{"text":"pollution"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.dnaindia.com/health/report-cold-fatigue-stress-make-vitamin-c-2263428","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-13T07:34:01.299Z","udate":"2016-10-13T09:53:32.439Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-13T07:33:00.000Z","title_or_id":"","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57ff38e933dc432310812201","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out2709.mp3","tagsForSearch":"colds,fatigue,stress,vitamin c,smoking,pollution","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

The same was true for heavy physical exertion during the hour before their first heart attack. However, the association was stronger (more than triple the risk) in those patients who recalled being angry or emotionally upset while also engaging in heavy physical exertion. \"Previous studies have explored these heart attack triggers; however, they had fewer participants or were completed in one country, and data are limited from many parts of the world,\" said lead author Andrew Smyth, researcher at the Population Health Research Institute at McMaster University in Canada.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"This is the first study to represent so many regions of the world, including the majority of the world's major ethnic groups,\" said Smyth.

He is the very image of innocence &mdash; pink lips puckered in sleep, his face chubby with baby fat. One of his eyes, however, is bandaged, a wide swath of white covering half his face, over which is scrawled W-H-Y; below, it says: \"Nasir Ahmed Khan/ 5 years old, Blinded, Kashmiri\".</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The reference is, of course, to the unrest in the Kashmir valley in the past four months, especially the hundreds who have been blinded by the pellet guns used by security personnel to combat protestors. Young Nasir was one of them. \"The one question that came to my mind when I saw Nasir's photograph in the papers was 'Why'?\" says Mujtaba Rizvi, the artist.</p>\n<div id=\"block-system-main\" class=\"block block-system clearfix\">\n<div class=\"article-content\">\n<div class=\"body-summary\">\n<div class=\"body-text\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Why </em>is part of an ongoing online exhibition called<em> To Art Is to Resist</em>, showcasing works made in response to Kashmir violence by artists in the Valley and outside. Gallerie1, which has mounted the show featuring 132 works by 36 artists, was founded by Rizvi who, besides being an arts practitioner, is also an impressario who has catalysed a vibrant contemporary arts scene in the troubled Valley in recent years.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In 2009, Mujtaba, then 21, started Kashmir Art Quest, the state's first contemporary arts organisation. In January, 2015, he started Gallerie1, Kashmir's first contemporary arts space. Soon after it opened, however, state tourism department officials, who had themselves offered him the space at the Tourist Reception Centre in Srinagar's Rajbagh locality, vandalised the gallery, destroyed paintings and seized the premises. Today, Gallerie1 survives in the virtual world, but Rizvi says he is preparing the grounds for re-launching Gallerie1's physical space.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kashmir has been peripheral to the Indian modern arts narrative &mdash; GR Santosh is the only Kashmiri artist to be known outside the state. A few names, such as Veer Munshi and Inder Salim, have been added in recent times. But going by the number of artists and the variety of mediums used &mdash; paintings and digital works, installations, graphic art, photography &mdash; in the show, there seems to be an efflorescence of contemporary art production in the Valley of late.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"There is,\" says Rizvi, \"a new breed of artists all over Kashmir today who are doing exciting work, addressing issues of violence and alienation that are occupying artists in other parts of the world. Even in places like Anantnag, Baramulla and Sopore, there are artists who have been doing remarkable work.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Clearly, the objective of the artists who have contributed works to the <em>To Art Is To Resist</em> exhibition is not, or not just, to make a pretty picture. It is to use their art to comment on the situation around them, on the violence and its immense human toll. There's anger but there's also pain, pathos, despair, loss, and the desire for freedom.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The one motif that abounds in nearly all the works is the damaged eye &mdash; bloodied, bandaged, pricked with bullet holes, or missing altogether. Danish Beg's <em>Caged Inside, Killed Outside</em> is one of the most powerful renditions of the theme. The painting is of a magnified eye, with the sclera, or the white portion, perforated with three pellet holes, with two more holes in the iris which shows two fists clenched as if against the bars of a prison rod; inside the pupil you can barely make out a face, innocent and sad.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then there's political cartoonist Mir Suhail's ironic renditions of famous images &mdash; a poster of the film<em> Kashmir ki Kali</em>, Vermeer's <em>Girl with a Pearl Earring</em>, Van Gogh's Self Portrait, Munch's <em>The Scream</em>, Da Vinci's <em>Mona Lisa</em>, photographs of Nehru, Gandhi and Bhagat Singh &mdash; digitally-altered to show their eyes covered with medical plaster or bandage. Another remarkable young talent seems to be Anantnag-based Azim Hassan who works in oil paint, using it in the traditional Western high-realistic mode. His <em>Blind Bullet</em> shows a young boy standing against an open window, holding a cat lovingly in his arms. It's an idyllic scene reminiscent of happy, bucolic scenes from a film, but there's nothing merry about this boy &ndash; his eyes are shut, his face impassive and even the cat is morose. Clearly, there's little out there to give him hope.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/508578-kashmir-curfew-afp-5-resized1476348135355.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57bab874ecbc9256e95c1835","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"book"},{"text":"sketch"},{"text":"artwork"},{"text":"kashmir art quest"},{"text":"contemporary arts"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/review-review-with-an-eye-on-conflict-2262546","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-13T08:42:28.915Z","udate":"2016-10-13T10:28:57.258Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-13T08:41:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57ff48f499095f6d987cc5e2","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6082.mp3","tagsForSearch":"book,sketch,artwork,kashmir art quest,contemporary arts","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told Pakistanis publicly in October 2011: &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbors.&rsquo; That was almost two decades after another US Secretary of State, James A Baker III, warned Pakistan about the prospect of being designated a state sponsor of terrorism.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Haqqani was Pakistan&rsquo;s ambassador in US. He has written couple of books like Pakistan: Between Mosque &amp; Military, Magnificent Delusions. He was involved in negotiations with US President George H W Bush&rsquo;s administration in 1991-92 as he was special assistant to then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Jihadi terrorism of 1991-92 was quite different then of todays..Pakistan&rsquo;s jihadi terrorism had not yet come out in the open. Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) were not big players. Let has 200 acre sprawling compound in Murdike, near Lahore and JeM has a big Madrasa in Bahawalpur. Baker wrote a letter to Sharif in May 1992saying that Pakistan take &lsquo;steps to make certain that Kashmiri and Sikh groups and individuals who have committed acts of terrorism do not receive support from Pakistani officials.&rsquo; Sharif responded saying his government is firmly opposed to terrorism in all its forms.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The March 1987 Jammu and Kashmir (J&amp;K) assembly elections is a major turning point. The controversial elections saw defeat of Muslim United Front (MUF). They could win only eight of seventy seats. Mohammad Yusuf Shah of MUF was declared winner earlier and later in a few minutes he was declared defeated and arrested. MUF accused that the polls were rigged. Shah later became Syed Salahuddin and heading a militant outfit Hizb-ul-Mujahideen from Pakistan. The 1987 elections provided an opportunity to Pakistan to influence people of Kashmir valley.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The pertinent question author raises is why cannot India and Pakistan be friends? Mistrust of each other is a major reason. &nbsp;He is concerned about &ldquo;shrinking space&rdquo; for both the countries to become friends. The absence of trust is an issue and it needs to be tackled. To revive trust between two governments and common people various steps have been taken but it is like One Step Forward and two Steps Back. Specific issues like Siachen, Sir Creek, people-to-people contact, WullarBarage etc. were identified and Composite dialogue began. It moved in a positive direction but could not move towards resolution as some blasts, attacks took place in Indian soil. The pattern of attacks clearly indicates that there are forces in both the countries who does not want to peace to prevail in the region. The policy needs to be uninterrupted and uninterruptible. In the absence of such policy, enemies of peace will always take advantage. The author says under the military&rsquo;s influence, Pakistani nationalism has evolved as anti-Indianism and Indian nationalism describes Pakistani identity as inherently communal and reiterates need to dispute the two-nation theory.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The current pause in the dialogue and mistrust between two countries is surprising. Mahatma Gandhi, an apostle of peace and father of the nation, always wanted good ties between two countries. In fact, he wanted to visit Pakistan but could not do so as NathuramGodse and his gang assassinated him on 30<sup>th</sup> January 1948. He lived for only few months in Independent India. Similarly, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Quaid-e-Azam of Pakistan, had a special affection for Mumbai city. He wished India and Pakistan to have an association similar to US and Canada. Even he did not survive long after Pakistan became an independent nation. He passed away on 11<sup>th</sup> September 1948. Both the great leaders were for the enduring peace between two countries. Jinnah gave importance to the secularism in Pakistan. His speech of 11<sup>th</sup> August 1947 before the constitution assembly Indicates it truly. &nbsp;He said,&rdquo; You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or any other place of worship in this state of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion caste or creed &ndash; that has nothing to do with the business of the state&rdquo;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The book is written objectively. It is not easy for any Indian or Pakistani to write objectively on the issue of India and Pakistan. Objectivity on the issue is seen with suspicious in his or her country. It is essential that more and more Indian and Pakistani writers writer objectively. Such kind of objectivity can help in removing misconception about other country and it can help in building trust.&nbsp; The book is a must read.

It is an irony that the popularity of chicken dishes is increasingly contributing to the difficulties doctors face in intensive care units to save a patient who has stopped responding to even the most powerful medicine.<br /></strong><br />The two scenarios are from two different sides of the spectrum, but they are linked through a common thread &ndash; antibiotic resistance.<br /><br />Rampant abuse of antibiotics &ndash; mainly as growth promoter &ndash; is abundant in the poorly regulated poultry sector. In the whole of Asia, antimicrobial consumption in chicken is expected to grow by 129% by 2030, and the extreme growth is being driven by the expansion of the poultry sector in India where areas of high consumption are expected to increase by 312% by 2030.<br /><br />Much of the global overuse of anti-microbial occurs in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), topped by the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) driving consumption in both animal and human sectors. <br /><br />An increased demand for animal protein accompanies the transition from low to higher incomes and is currently met by more intensive farming practices, argues Ramanan Laxminarayan, Director, Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, Washington DC.<br /><br />Historically, these practices rely on sub-therapeutic doses of antibiotics for animal growth promotion, a practice banned in the European Union since 2006. Moreover, there is wide scale treatment of healthy animals to prevent them from getting sick and hence avoiding reduced productivity. Only a small section of the industry follows the veterinary standards.<br /><br />The scale-up in antibiotic use in India has been enabled by rapid economic growth, rising incomes and unethical medical practices accompanied by marginal improvements in sanitation, water access, public health and infection control. Growing antibiotic use in the animal sector is resulting in greater selection of pathogens and is being driven by increased demand for meat and poultry. An Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report indicated that the cost of withdrawing antimicrobial growth promoters in India would be roughly $1.1 billion.<br /><br />In some of the high and middle-income nations, the trends in antibiotic consumption in humans are being tracked, but antimicrobial consumption in livestock has received little attention. While some experts suggest that the global consumption of anti-microbial in animals is twice that of&nbsp; humans, the underlying data support from the veterinary sector is weak.<br /><br />Feeding or spraying large quantities of extremely powerful antibiotics to chickens does not mean that one can become resistant to the antibiotics by eating the meat. But abuse by the poultry industry exposes the pathogens to powerful antibiotics and through the process of natural selection, the bugs stop responding to those medicines over time. They emerge more virulent. When these drug-resistant microbes strike, the doctors are left with few options in their armoury. The babies and the elderly are the most vulnerable.<br /><br />A team of paediatricians from three major Delhi hospitals &mdash; All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Safdarjung Hospital and LNJP Hospital &mdash; recently gave a presentation showing the severity of the threat among infants after examining thousands of live births in these hospitals between 2011 and 2014. <br /><br />The medical researchers recruited more than 13,500 neonates for the study. Out of them, 9,100 did not have any clinical symptoms of sepsis, but 4,400 were assessed for infection in the blood. More than 2,100 were detected with sepsis and nearly a quarter of them died.<br /><br />&ldquo;The most important findings of our study include early occurrence of sepsis, identification of classic late-onset nosocomial pathogens causing early onset of sepsis and an alarming degree of antimicrobial resistance to even reserve antibiotics,&rdquo; investigators of the Delhi Neonatal Infection Study (DeNIS) reported in the October 2016 issue of the Lancet Global Health.<br /><br /><strong>Infection control</strong><br /><br />This means, within three days of birth, a large number of babies in government hospitals can pick up a deadly infection from the hospital and die, thanks to extremely poor infection-control measures. The infections are there in the first place due to antibiotic abuse. The overall burden of resistance is hard to assess for the general population, but neonates and the elderly population are at a higher risks.<br /><br />Antibiotic resistance is a global threat but nowhere is it as stark as in India. The crude infectious disease mortality rate in India is 416.75 per 1,00,000 persons, which is twice the rate prevailing in the US when antibio-tics were introduced. In 2010, India was the world&rsquo;s largest consumer of antibiotics for human health ahead of China and the US. <br /><br />The government&rsquo;s plan to restrict over-the-counter sale of antibiotics remains largely on paper. Strict enforcement of the prescription sales has also to be seen in the context of lack of access to effective and affordable medicine as absence of antibiotics still kills more children in India than drug resistance does. But future looks worrisome.<br /><br />Modelling studies have shown that by 2030, antimicrobial consumption will rise by 67% and nearly double in the BRICS nations. And by 2050, antimicrobial resistance will kill almost 10 million people each year and 90% of them would be from the LMIC. Because of the looming threat, the United Nations on September 21 discussed the issue at a special session of the General Assembly. This is only the fourth time in history that a subject on health has featured in the UNGA.<br /><br />One of the ideas on the table is to create a Global Antimicrobial Conservation Fund to stem the overuse of antibiotics. Among others, the fund would support antimicrobial stewardship programmess in the LMIC countries, including the BRICS nations, currently driving consumption in both animal and human sectors. This would be one of the most cost-effective ways of mitigating the risk posed by the transnational migration of resistant microbes, Laxminarayan argued in an editorial in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases.</p>","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf9a2ea63af2cd0d81d6b","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"antibiotic resistance"},{"text":"ramanan laxminarayan"},{"text":"sanitation"},{"text":"water access"},{"text":"public health"},{"text":"infection control."}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/575250/antibiotic-resistance-cause-concern-spreading.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-13T08:52:39.168Z","udate":"2016-10-13T10:01:30.629Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-13T08:50:00.000Z","title_or_id":"Book Review: 'Words Matter: Writings Against Silence' - The idea of protest","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57ff4b57c87f523c37223839","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out1566.mp3","tagsForSearch":"antibiotic resistance,ramanan laxminarayan,sanitation,water access,public health,infection control.","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Also, weight-bearing joints like knees and hips undergo extra strain in case of obese patients, worsening their condition.\"<br /><br />According to a study by Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the US, around 1 in 3 obese people suffer from arthritis, whereas about 2 out of 3 Americans are either overweight or obese.<br /><br />With poor lifestyle, food habits, lack of physical activity etc, instances of obesity have been on a rise, directly affecting the number of arthritic patients.<br /><br />Director of Mumbai-based AXIS Hospitals and Orthopedic Surgeon Umesh Shetty said a large number of patients suffering from arthritis and other related problems are either overweight or obese.<br /><br />\"Half the patients who come to me for knee replacements or other arthritic problems are either overweight or obese. We prefer and guide them for a non-surgical treatment as first line of treatment if the cases are not severe and help them to facilitate losing weight,\" Shetty told PTI.<br /><br />\"Weight loss can reduce stress on weight-bearing joints and therefore, limit further injury and delay the progress of arthritic condition,\" he said.<br /><br />Obesity causes excess fat in the body which releases inflammatory chemicals that may play a role in increasing instances of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Experts believe inflammatory chemicals like cytokines can impact different body systems.<br /><br />According to studies quoted by Arthritis Foundation, a USA-based NGO, about 70 per cent of people with gout are overweight and 14 per cent are obese, and therefore, obesity also puts a person at a higher risk of developing gout apart from osteoarthritis.<br /><br />\"In order to control excess joint stress and inflammatory chemicals, it is advisable to keep the fat in control among all people and in particularly those who suffer from osteoarthritis,\" Bhat said.<br /><br />\"We advise such patients to undergo treatment with a qualified physiotherapist for strengthening their quadriceps and hamstring muscles so as to reduce the weight-burden on the knee joint. We also recommend non-invasive physiotherapies like ultrasonic therapy for knee joints, TENS (Trans Electrical Nerve Stimulation) etc,\" Shetty added.<br /><br />In cases of arthritic patients also suffering from obesity, as a first line of action doctors suggest them to improve joint care through rest and exercise, maintain an acceptable body weight, control pain with medicine and other measures and achieve a healthy lifestyle in order to delay the progress of arthritis, he said.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/obesityy1476348835842.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf9a2ea63af2cd0d81d6b","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/575533/obesity-arthritis-linked-medical-experts.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-13T08:54:08.731Z","udate":"2016-10-13T10:01:49.256Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-13T08:53:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57ff4bb088b8006a7219595a","tags":[{"text":"obesity"},{"text":"arthritis"},{"text":"lifestyle"},{"text":"food habits"},{"text":"physical exercise"},{"text":"world arthritis day"}],"pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out9368.mp3","tagsForSearch":"obesity,arthritis,lifestyle,food habits,physical exercise,world arthritis day","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

They are made of elastomers, including silicon and rubber, and so they are inherently safe.<br /><br />They are controlled by changing the air pressure in specially designed 'soft balloons', which also serve as the robot's body. Potential applications for these robots include patient rehabilitation, handling fragile objects, biomimetic systems and home care.<br /><br />Researchers developed soft robots for medical purposes. One of their designs is a belt made of several inflatable components, which holds patients upright during rehabilitation exercises and guides their movements.<br /><br />\"We are working with physical therapists from the University Hospital of Lausanne (CHUV) who are treating stroke victims,\" said Matthew Robertson, the researcher in charge of the project.<br /><br />\"The belt is designed to support the patient's torso and restore some of the person's motor sensitivity,\" said Robertson.<br /><br />The belt's soft actuators are made of pink rubber and transparent fishing line. The placement of the fishing line guides the modules' deformation very precisely when air is injected.<br /><br />\"For now, the belt is hooked up to a system of external pumps. The next step will be to miniaturise this system and put it directly on the belt,\" said Robertson.<br /><br />Researchers showed that their model could accurately predict how a series of modules &ndash; composed of compartments and sandwiched chambers &ndash; moves. The cucumber-shaped actuators can stretch up to around five or six times their normal length and bend in two directions, depending on the model.<br />\"We conducted numerous simulations and developed a model for predicting how the actuators deform as a function of their shape, thickness and the materials they're made of,\" said Gunjan Agarwal, from EPFL.<br /><br />One of the variants consists of covering the actuator in a thick paper shell made by origami. This test showed that different materials could be used. The researchers are also using soft actuators to develop adaptable robots that are capable of navigating around in cramped, hostile environments.<br /><br />\"Using soft actuators, we can come up with robots of various shapes that can move around in diverse environments,\" said Jamie Paik, EPFL's Reconfigurable Robotics Lab (RRL).<br /><br />\"They are made of inexpensive materials, and so they could easily be produced on a large scale. This will open new doors in the field of robotics,\" Paik said.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/robots1476348999196.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baabc5ecbc9256e95c1763","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"robots"},{"text":"human muscles"},{"text":"impairments"},{"text":"stroke victims"},{"text":"epfl"},{"text":"muscles"},{"text":"stroke"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/575535/soft-robots-mimic-human-muscles.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-13T08:56:51.235Z","udate":"2016-10-13T10:02:12.176Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-13T08:56:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57ff4c5333dc4323108122b0","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out3957.mp3","tagsForSearch":"robots,human muscles,impairments,stroke victims,epfl,muscles,stroke","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

It is not a mere travelogue. It is more than that. The author tries exploring historical, spiritual places on the way and connects it with the similar places in other countries. In 2011, he began his travel from Dhaka to Europe via India, Pakistan and Iran. Most of his journey was on buses, trains and cars. He had no other options but to fly to India from Bangladesh, Pakistan from India and Iran from Pakistan. It took him nearly 60 days. Finally he left for Turkey from Iran.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The book covers first leg of his journey from Bangladesh to Iran. He selected cities, towns meticulously. He flew to Kolkata from Dhaka and then to Patna. He found graceful professionalism at Kolkata&rsquo;s International and domestic airport and experienced a new India. Even in Patna railway station, where he went to book Patna to Delhi and Amritsar to Delhi tickets, officials were helpful. The author is British-Bangladeshi citizen. He also noticed little difference in Bangladesh and West Bengal&rsquo;s Bengali. Before leaving Dhaka, he thought he may find little difficulties in India as he is a Muslim. But, he never felt discrimination. Similarly, he thought he will find difficulty in Pakistan as he is from Bangladesh. Even in Pakistan, he never felt discrimination.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is not easy to enter by road to other country in South Asia. Zeeshan Khan went up to Attari on India-Pakistan border but had to return to Delhi from Amritsar to take flight to Lahore. The Pakistani High Commission in Bangladesh did not give him visa to cross border on foot. So, though he was barely 30 km away from Lahore he had to go to Delhi which is around 450 km from Amritsar. He was in Patna on Eid, the day after the holy month of Ramzan. Surprisingly, author has used word Ramadan, which is not South Asian. The word Ramadan came to South Asia with the petro-dollars and money coming from mid-east countries.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"center\">&nbsp;</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bodh Gaya is the most sacred place for Buddhist. Here, Siddhartha became the Buddha. He also travelled to Rajgir and Nalanda in Bihar. Twenty fourth and last Jain tirthankara Mahavira spent fourteen year in Rajgir. The cave at vulture&rsquo;s peak was Buddha&rsquo;s favourite place. Nalanda was called one of the &lsquo;first great universities in recorded history&rsquo;, formally commenced in 3<sup>rd</sup> century, during the regime of Gupta king Kumaragupta. Author also visited Delhi, Amritsar. Apart from Golden Temple and Jalianwala Baug, he went to Attari {popularly referred as Wagah) border. &nbsp;Author writes the atmosphere is carnival like. It is all about nationalism. Daily hundreds of people visit to watch lowering of the flags ceremony. Zeeshan Khan watched the ceremony from other side also when he travelled to Pakistan.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Pakistan he visited Lahore, Islamabad, Taxila, Multan, Quetta. Pakistan is fighting for its survival but at the same time Saudi funded Wahabi movement growing inside it like a tumor, felt Zeeshan. Taxila was originally called as Takshashila. The book says Takshashila was named after Taksha, Lord Rama&rsquo;s brother. Factually, it is incorrect. Taksha was the son of Lord Rama&rsquo;s brother Bharata.&nbsp; After Mohen-jo-daro, Taxila is the most visited site in Pakistan. Takshashila and Nalanda were two most popular universities. Takshashila produced some of the finest minds in the fields of history, mathematics, science, medicine, law etc.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though Pakistan is not safe and secure but Pakistanis are fabulous he writes. They say their city or country is as safe and secure as any other country or city. This spirit keeps them enjoying every moment. He writes about collapse of train system in Pakistan. Trains never run on time. Once he missed train as train was on time. He travelled to Quetta in train to get firsthand experience. While in train they were told that 26 Hazara Shias were pulled off from a Taftan-bound bus and shot dead at Mastung near Quetta. They were going to Iran for a pilgrimage. Zeeshan&rsquo;s original plan was to take a train to Zahedan in Iran. But, he came to know that Iran has stopped train years ago following incidences of violence. Iran is a Shia majority country and Pakistan Sunni. Iranian province of Sistan va Baluchistan has a sizeable Sunni population. To cross over to Pakistan, Zeeshan had no other option but to fly to Zahedan. He could not cross border on foot or vehicle.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He travelled to Zahedan, Kerman, Rayen, Mashhad, Yazd, Esfahan, Tehran and couple of other cities in Iran. Masshad is Iran&rsquo;s second largest city and holiest and it means &lsquo;the place of martydom&rsquo;. Imam Ali ar-Ridha, the eighth of the Shia imam was buried here. Yazd has the largest Zoroastrian community in Iran.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It took three and a half years to write the book. He did lot of research on historical cities of India, Pakistan and Iran. The cities were selected on the basis of their significance, relevance in the history. The book is full of cultural, historical, religious references.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The book Right to Passage is meant for the South Asian audience. The book is enjoyable to read. It has 390 pages and is priced Rs. 595. The book is published by Sage.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/Right-to-Passage1476349114341.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57fbaa65b38e1d5d6a0c4ab0","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"26 hazara shias"},{"text":"baluchistan"},{"text":"book review"},{"text":"zeeshan khan"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57fb6fc4e66f216b816f52ca","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.freepressjournal.in/book-reviews/right-to-passage-travels-through-india-pakistan-and-iran-by-zeeshan-khan/913785","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-13T08:58:45.634Z","udate":"2016-10-20T12:52:07.284Z","expirydate":"2017-02-05T08:50:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-13T08:50:00.000Z","publiseherSectionId":"57ff0f0cf0b8064697ceb047","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57ff4cc556722922f77850de","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out1219.mp3","audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"26 hazara shias,baluchistan,book review,zeeshan khan","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

The participants chosen for this study ranged in age from 45 to 84, and 51 per cent were female.<br /><br />At the study's onset in 2000, all participants answered a 120-part questionnaire about their dietary habits to determine how much calcium they took in by eating dairy products, leafy greens and calcium-enriched foods such as cereals.<br /><br />For the analysis, the researchers first split the participants into five groups based on their total calcium intake, including both calcium supplements and dietary calcium.<br /><br />After adjusting the data for age, sex, race, exercise, smoking, income, education, weight, smoking, drinking, blood pressure, blood sugar and family medical history, researchers separated out 20 per cent of participants with the highest total calcium intake, which was greater than 1,400 milligrammes of calcium a day.<br /><br />That group was found to be on average 27 per cent less likely than the 20 per cent of participants with the lowest calcium intake - less than 400 milligrammes of daily calcium - to develop heart disease, as indicated by their coronary artery calcium test.<br />The research was published in the Journal of the American Heart Association.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/calcium1476349427324.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baabc5ecbc9256e95c1763","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"calcium"},{"text":"supplements"},{"text":"arteries"},{"text":"heart"},{"text":"calcium-rich foods"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/575359/calcium-supplements-may-damage-your.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-13T09:04:01.217Z","udate":"2016-10-13T10:02:56.713Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-13T09:03:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57ff4e0133dc4323108122c4","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out2458.mp3","tagsForSearch":"calcium,supplements,arteries,heart,calcium-rich foods","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Previously, it was thought that the heart started to contract a stage later, when the heart appears as a linear tube.<br /><br />Congenital heart disease is diagnosed in at least one in 180 births, which equates to around 4,000 each year &ndash; or 12 babies every day &ndash; in the UK.<br /><br />The researchers hope that by understanding more about how the heart forms in the womb, they will one day be able to prevent heart conditions that arise as a foetus develops.<br /><br />By adding fluorescent markers to calcium molecules within the mouse embryo, the team was able to see at which point in time the calcium tells our heart muscle cells to contract and then become coordinated enough to produce a heartbeat.<br /><br />The team also found that this initiation of beating was essential for the heart to develop properly at an early stage and that a protein called NCX1 plays a key role in the generation of the calcium signals needed to produce the beating action of the heart.<br /><br />The heart is the first organ to form during pregnancy and is critical in providing oxygen and nutrients to the developing embryo.<br /><br />The process of heart development is highly conserved between mammalian species, meaning that these findings may add considerably to our understanding of how the human heart develops.<br /><br />\"We are trying to better understand how the heart develops, and ultimately what causes the heart defects that develop in the womb before birth and to extrapolate to adult heart repair,\" said Paul Riley, who led the research at the University of Oxford.<br /><br />\"By finding out how the heart first starts to beat and how problems can arise in heart development, we are one step closer to being able to prevent heart conditions from arising during pregnancy,\" Riley said.<br /><br />Researchers hope that the findings will bring them closer to being able to repair damaged muscle after a heart attack.<br /><br />One of the main difficulties with repairing the heart is that the new cells need to connect and synchronise their beating with the existing tissue.<br /><br />Just like making origami, without having the right set of instructions it becomes much more difficult to make a heart, or even parts of the heart, with the right form and function.<br /><br />By finding out how and when the heart first starts to beat, the team has uncovered some of the 'instructions' that may help them transform stem cells into fully functional cardiac cells in the lab.

M. Lakhera&rsquo;s book, &lsquo;Towards Resurgent India&rsquo; :</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I had gone to the UK as Deputy Leader of the Indian Delegation to take part in 50th Anniversary Celebrations of &lsquo;Victory in Europe&rsquo; during the Second World War. I, along with other army officers, had just stepped out after attending the inaugural session and was waiting roadside for the traffic to ease so as to walk across the road to the vehicle park. Along with me was Hony Captain Umrao Singh, a Victoria Cross-winner. All of a sudden, a car moving on the road came to a halt in front of us and a well-dressed gentleman stepped out. He approached Umrao Singh and said, &ldquo;Sir, may I have the privilege to shake hands with a Victoria Cross-winner?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He shook hands with him. Evidently he had spotted Umrao Singh&rsquo;s medal from the car and had stopped his car to pay his respects to a winner of the highest gallantry award of his country.&rdquo;</p>\n<div align=\"center\">&nbsp;</div>\n<p>That gentleman was Michael Haseltine, Deputy Prime Minister of UK.</p>\n<p>All the traffic behind his car had come to a standstill. M. M. Lakhera politely requested him to move along to relieve the traffic hold up.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sir, how dare I drive off when the Victoria Cross has to cross the road?&rdquo; replied Deputy Prime Minister of UK.</p>\n<p>Major General Ian Cardozo was commissioned into the 5<sup>th</sup>Gorkha Rifles and has taken part in the Sino-Indian war of 1962 and Indo-Pak wars of 1965 and 1971. He is the first officer of the Indian Army to be awarded the Sena medal for gallantry on a patrol on the Sion-India border in 1960. Wounded in the 1971 war, he overcame the handicap of an amputated limb and became the first disabled officer of the Indian Army to command an infantry battalion. After the retirement, he was appointed Chairman of the Rehabilitation Council of India. His books- ParamVir: Our Heros in Battle, The Sinking of INS Khukri, In Quest of Freedom and other, focused on chronicling the exploits of war heroes. In this book, he has documented stories of 11 Indians who won the Victoria Cross during World War I.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The Victoria Cross was established in 1855 but Indians became eligible for this prestigious award in 1911. The Indian army, then did not have artillery, was not trained in modern warfare and had the weapons that were generation old. Soon after the declaration of war, Indian army- British Expeditionary Force that consisted of six infantry divisions and one cavalry division arrived in Francce in mid-August 1914. The Indian forces were ill-equipped. They were in their summer uniforms in the onset of European winter and were armed with obsolete weapons to fight a war they were not trained for; yet they fought with discipline, dedication and courage. Indian units fought in Europe, Mesopotamia, Egypt, Palestine, East Africa and China. Over one million Indians served overseas. How fierce was the theatre of war? In March 1915 in the battle of NeuveChapelle the Indian Corps&rsquo; total casualties were:&nbsp; British Officers&mdash;41 killed, 91 wounded, 1 missing, other ranks- British and Indian- 772 killed, 2,956 wounded, 312 missing. Overall, 835 killed, 3,083 wounded, missing 315. Territorial gain was about 1,000 yards over a two-mile front. In this battle Gabbar Singh Negi received posthumous Victoria Cross.</p>\n<p>In this book, we get the stories of all the eleven Indians, who won the VC during the Great War.&nbsp; The bravest of the braves are Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians from undivided India. Why do the soldiers fight with courage? According to the author&mdash;it is the honour of Profession of Arms, it is also the honour of the regiment. The values of commitment, comradeship, duty, discipline, and the loyalty fostered in the regiments are also the factors that motivate the soldier in the execution of his task. It appears that two modern values&mdash;liberty and equality, does not have a place in the profession of arms but the stability of modern nation-state is very much anchored in the feudal values, the ideological basis of the armed forces.&nbsp; Lt Gen S K Sinha has rightly recommended this book for the students of Indian military history.</p>\n<p>The last chapter of the book&mdash;Conclusion,Maj Gen Ian Cardozo notes that in India, we don&rsquo;t have a War Memorial of the Unknown Soldiers. &ldquo;All that we have in India, is the &lsquo;Amar Jawan&rsquo;, a temporary structure ordered by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, in the shadow of India Gate as there was not enough time to make a permanent war memorial between 16 December 1971 and 26 January 1972. Since the day that the Amar Jawan temporary structure was made, forty-four years have passed and all that we have so far is promises and plans. Politicians and the bureaucrat fail to understand a well known truism that &lsquo;A country that fails to honour its war dead dishonours itself&rsquo;. &ldquo;</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/The-Bravest-of-the1476350002799.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57fbaa65b38e1d5d6a0c4ab0","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"hony captain umrao singh"},{"text":"indian vcs of world war i"},{"text":"resurgent india"},{"text":"undivided india"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57fb6fc4e66f216b816f52ca","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.freepressjournal.in/book-reviews/the-bravest-of-the-brave/921588","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-13T09:13:31.203Z","udate":"2016-10-20T12:52:16.625Z","expirydate":"2017-03-01T09:09:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-13T09:08:00.000Z","publiseherSectionId":"57ff0f0cf0b8064697ceb047","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57ff503b88b8006a7219597f","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out2965.mp3","audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"hony captain umrao singh,indian vcs of world war i,resurgent india,undivided india","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

{"_id":"57ff58b988b8006a721959ce","title":"Letters Speak: Tanya Tania","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb900dea63af2cd0d814cf","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There&rsquo;s a Tanya Talathi in Karachi and a Tania Ghosh in Mumbai. This is a story based on letters &ldquo;exchanged&rdquo; between them from February 14, 1991 to December 9, 1992. If either of them is conscious of the fact that the first letter was written on Valentine&rsquo;s Day, it is not reflected in their correspondence. But the date of the last letter coincides with the horrors of the Bhendi Bazar riots post the demolition of Babri Masjid. The mothers of Tanya and Tania were friends, having attended the same college. But one is American and the other is Indian. The American one leaves her husband (and a son) in Pakistan to live in the US with her daughter, Tanya. Tania&rsquo;s mother and father are constantly quarrelling over trifles.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tanya who lived in Karachi before her parents separated decides to write to Tania who lives in Mumbai. A total of 72 letters are exchanged over a period of around 23 months. There are references to the strong presence of a mother by both of them; Tanya has a twin brother called Navi, Tania has an elder brother called Sammy; Tanya has a servant/attendant called Chhoti Bibi while Tania has one called Nusrat. Chotti Bibi, whom Tanya tries to teach basic mathematics and chess, fled from her village after she bit her husband on their wedding night; Nusrat is deaf and therefore unable to speak. Tanya wants to go to the US for higher studies while Tania is content with studying in Mumbai.Tania in Mumbai has a boyfriend called Arjun and Tanya in Karachi has one called Ali Naqvi. Both the boyfriends are the best looking guys in the college. There are references to sexual activity and the dislike for it &ndash; on the part of one or the other &ndash; and then the realisation that Ali Naqvi is gay. The letters speed back and forth between Karachi and Mumbai in a sort of compulsive assurance of one&rsquo;s existence, to the other &ndash; or is it oneself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If the reader is confused it is not surprising.Besides the uneasy feeling of reading somebody&rsquo;s private letters, there is confusion more confounded. The letter dated September 1, 1991 is not addressed to anyone&ndash; though Tania&rsquo;s name appears at the end of it. Did Tania forget to address the letter to her friend? Or was it immaterial whether she addressed it at all? Then on November 7, 1992, Tania writes to Tania. While the contents point towards Tania&rsquo;s authorship one wonders whether it is the printer who has inadvertently added to the confusion.Or was it intended by the author &ndash; as a reflection of the mental state of the protagonist(s)?It is therefore remarkable how Fatima Bhutto,quoted on the front cover, claims,&ldquo;I was on the last page before I knew it&rdquo;. Aquestion,though, keeps bugging the reader: Are Tanya and Tania really two different persons? But ShobhaaDe&rsquo;s quote on the front cover saysthat this is a &ldquo;narrative that immediately draws you into the intimate worlds of a complex friendship&rdquo;.Which implies the presence of at least two persons. And De cannot be wrong.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The question remains, pesters. The stream of correspondence stops around the time of the riots in Mumbai. Then after around three-and-a-half years, Tanya resumes her writing from New York &ndash; not expecting any replies from Tania in Mumbai, and saying so. From February 4 to May 29 of 1996 she indulges in a sort of manic monologue, knowing that Tania will never answer. She refers to herselfas having been in a &ldquo;hospital for mad people&rdquo;, and to sessions with a therapist. For no reason other than in furtherance of obfuscation, the authorintroduces these New York letters by dispersing them haphazardly among the earlier correspondence of 1991-92. The reader&rsquo;s mindwould need to be extremely organised, if the book is to be read in one straight session and understood &ndash; so as to reach the end before &ldquo;I knew it&rdquo;. The last letter in the collection is from Tania in Mumbai is on December 9, 1992: the day on which Nusrat disappears.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The therapist that Tanya goes to in New York, calls it &ldquo;transference&rdquo; when she describes scenes from the Bhendi Bazar riots, when she claims that she has never been to Mumbai in all her life. In fact, Tanya &ldquo;sees&rdquo;and describes the route taken by Tania from her residence through the riot-torn areas in search of Nusrat, as clearly as she sees the old man lying naked across the threshold of a shop and Tania turns her face away from his genitals, &ldquo;like softly spreading wax between his legs&rdquo;. In fact this image continues to haunt Tanya for years. In a splendidly short spell of lucidity, Tanya describes the city of ghosts that Mumbai had turned into and the eerie silence that billowed around her as she crept along the streets &ndash; the silence of fear &ndash; only to be broken by the raucous cries of the gangs of fellow-citizens turned into marauders and predators. She describes how the &ldquo;silence feels slick&rdquo; to Tania as clearly as she talks of the smell of the dead, their bodies lying over each other in illicit embrace.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At the end there is only Tanya in Columbia University, only Tanya graduating with the highest GPA.There is only Tanya screaming out in her letters from New York: what happened to you happened to me!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is when Tania in Mumbai decides to write the first of her letters to Nusrat &hellip; wishing her a happy birthday. Nusratwould have been eighteen.

proof that honey has been prized by humans since the dawn of civilization.Acupuncture: The history of acupuncture dates back to the New Stone Age in China, when stones were first fashioned into needles for medicinal uses.<br /><br />The techniques were later perfected by the Chinese, and have now been adopted across the globe for treating a variety of conditions, including chronic pain, depression, addiction and many other ailments.A variation on the theme is cupping, in which heated glass cups are used to create suction and then applied to the skin, increasing blood flow and stimulating tissues.<br /><br />Modern-day cupping techniques often use other methods to create suction, and are now often used by athletes and others to speed up healing after training and competition.Aloe Vera: For millennia, the aloe vera plant has been used both topically and internally for its nearly-miraculous medicinal properties.<br /><br />Aloe is very effective for treating burns and sunburn, and is good for the skin and facial complexion.Aloe has antioxidant properties, and can be used internally to treat constipation and even to lower blood sugar levels in diabetics.<br /><br />It is also useful for treating mouth ulcers and canker sores, and reducing dental plaque.Hand-washing: Although ancient cultures lacked an understanding of bacteria, viruses and infections, ritual hand washing has been practiced for a very long time:\"Observant Jews throughout history have washed their hands for ritual purposes, such as before meals, and the cleaning is believed to have had a broader effect, such as partly helping to keep the Black Death from ravaging the medieval Jewish community as severely as it had others.\"Since Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis made handwashing a popular idea in the medical community [1850], it has saved countless lives.\"Willow Bark: The bark of the willow tree has been utilized since antiquity for its analgesic, anti-inflammatory and fever-reducing properties.<br /><br />Aspirin was first derived from salicin, the active ingredient in willow bark.Willow bark can be used to treat acne, headache, menstrual pain, arthritis and back pain.<br /><br />It is also used in the prevention of heart attacks.Aspirin is now being investigated for its cancer-fighting properties, and there is evidence that suggests that willow bark may be even more effective in destroying cancer cells.Our ancestors were smarter than we thoughtThe reason all of these ancient treatments still survive is because they really work.Our ancestors weren't as primitive as they are sometimes portrayed;

which is the toxin's most hazardous form.<br /><br />While the average American has just three dental fillings, approximately 25 percent of the population has 11 or more fillings.<br /><br />The evidence from this study suggests that those people in particular are at risk of suffering the negative effects of mercury.The ADA has responded to this study by insisting that amalgams are completely safe and has tried to imply that the study may be \"overestimating\" the impact of mercury in dental amalgam.<br /><br />However, because the study included fillings that were made from both dental amalgam and mercury-free composites, Dr.<br /><br />Yu notes that this could lead to an under-estimation of the negative impact mercury is actually having on people across the country.While dental health may not be a top priority for most, is it really worth being poisoned over?</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/dental1476352908625.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57fbaa65b38e1d5d6a0c4ab0","publisherSectionName":"deccannews9.com","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"dental fillings"},{"text":"dentists"},{"text":"cavity"},{"text":"mercury levels"},{"text":"dental amalgams"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccannews9.com/Health/dental-fillings-are-raising-mercury-in-blood-to-alarming-levelsdn9com:13015","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-13T10:02:01.227Z","udate":"2016-10-13T10:05:24.414Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-13T10:01:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","publiseherSectionId":"57ff529599095f6d987cc634","statsId":"57ff5b991345ff415e33d3a8","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out3430.mp3","tagsForSearch":"dental fillings,dentists,cavity,mercury levels,dental amalgams","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

The former as unquestionable as the flow of the Ganga with its estuarine embraces over Bangladesh before it meets the Bay of Bengal; the latter as natural and worrying as the tectonic shifts of the subcontinental plate &ndash; alarming, deep, and unsettling. The former resulted in marriage. The latter in constant yearnings, intermittently satisfied.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is a story of a team of paleontological explorers and their intellectual moorings to the skeletal remains of a prehistoric, amphibian whale called Ambulocetus (nicknamed Diana) probably washed on the shores of the ancient Tethys and the gut-wrenching description of the lives involved in dismantling a mighty cruise ship called <em>Grace,</em> on a beach in Chittagong. The former is an activity permitted by a militia that couldn&rsquo;t have cared lessfor the multi-millennia of natural preservation they stood on; the latter is an activity encouraged by the Government for reclamation of precious steel at the cost of precious lives of its citizens.&ldquo;Bones of grace&rdquo; is what a local member of the Diana team dubs the assembled vertebrae &ndash; and then he is imprisoned and killed by the militia for being the son of a rival chieftain;<em>Grace</em>is systematically reduced to its bare bones as the narrator comes closer and closer to a kind of self-realisation on different planes of her existence.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is a story of continual hope: that on unearthing Diana&rsquo;s hip bones and her femur a major part of the paleontological, evolutionary mystery would be solved; that a movie on the plight of those engaged in ship-breaking would &ldquo;make a dent in the world&rdquo;; that on finding the object of one&rsquo;s search, the seeker will find peace within and the world will be the better for it.

Each of the three books is a stand-alone &ndash; with the Bangladesh freedom struggle as the backdrop, and Tehmima carries the war-scarred and other players with aplomb.Each character is skilfully, carefully carved, whether it is the rich and comfortable in Dhaka or the wretched God-forsaken workers (where &ldquo;the atmosphere had been thinned by the fleeing of hope&rdquo;) in Chittagong; the cultural nuances as seen in traditions and interpersonal relationships are brought out in stark contrast, sometimes, to the narrator&rsquo;s &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; habits of food, fellowship and frankness. One marvels at the very subcontinental emotions and emotional reactions portrayed by the author.It&rsquo;s a letter addressed to that stranger to explain everything that happened and everything that could not happen.

particularly in white blood cells and in the epithelial layer of the respiratory system.<br /><br />This sparked an interest in whether the vitamin might play a role in immune or respiratory health.Since then, numerous studies have confirmed that vitamin D plays a key role in immune regulation.<br /><br />Low levels of vitamin D have been strongly linked to a wide variety of autoimmune diseases, which share many physiological characteristics with allergies and asthma.<br /><br />Observational studies have also confirmed that asthma patients with lower blood levels of vitamin D are more likely to suffer from asthma attacks.For the new studies, the researchers examined 81 separate studies into the connection between vitamin D and asthma attacks.<br /><br />From these, they identified nine that were double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized trials &ndash; considered the gold standard in medical research.The researchers looked at several different asthma-related outcomes, including a worsening of symptoms severe enough to require an emergency room visit, hospital admission, or oral corticosteroid treatment; day-to-day asthma symptoms; lung function; exhaled nitric oxide; and biomarkers of airway inflammation.The researchers found that people who took vitamin D supplements were 50 percent less likely to suffer from asthma attacks severe enough to require emergency room visits or hospital admission.<br /><br />They also reduced the risk of treatment with oral steroids.Notably, vitamin D showed no effect on day-to-day asthma symptoms or any of the other biomarkers that the researchers examined.Vitamin D fights infection, inflammationBecause of the design of the initial studies, the researchers were not able to determine whether vitamin D supplementation helped all patients, or merely those who were deficient in vitamin D before the study began.<br /><br />They have now partnered with the principal investigators of the nine initial studies to be able to review individual patient data.The researchers hope that this collaboration will indicate a threshold above which vitamin D is shown to reduce the risk of severe asthma attacks, which will in turn allow them to make a clinical recommendation.Although it is impossible to say exactly why vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of attacks, prior studies showing a strong link between vitamin D and asthma are able to offer several possibilities.<br /><br />Some studies have shown, for example, that vitamin D can suppress inflammatory responses, including those that produce asthma attacks.Studies have also shown that vitamin D helps induce immune responses when the body detects infection with an upper respiratory virus, like a cold or flu.<br /><br />These viruses are major triggers of asthma attacks.Martineau offered two main cautions regarding the research.<br /><br />First, he noted that only about half of asthma patients suffer from a form severe enough to be at risk of the attacks examined in the study.<br /><br />It is unclear if or how vitamin D might affect people with these more mild forms of the disease.He also noted that all the trials used vitamin D supplementation in addition to regular treatment, not as a replacement.<br /><br />Severe asthma attacks can be life-threatening.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/asthma1476353891339.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57be813e58e60350c6266ce2","publisherSectionName":"deccannews9.com","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"vitamin d"},{"text":"asthma attacks"},{"text":"cochrane collaboration"},{"text":"bone health"},{"text":"white blood cells"},{"text":"respiratory system"},{"text":"allergies"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccannews9.com/Health/vitamin-d-protects-against-asthma-reduces-attacks-by-50dn9com:13014","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-13T10:18:24.147Z","udate":"2016-10-13T12:50:00.579Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-13T10:17:00.000Z","publiseherSectionId":"57ff5f701345ff415e33d3ec","title_or_id":"","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57ff5f701345ff415e33d3eb","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6259.mp3","tagsForSearch":"vitamin d,asthma attacks,cochrane collaboration,bone health,white blood cells,respiratory system,allergies","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Here are a set of workout and physical activities, which when combined with an ideal eating plan and cardio workouts can assure you of the killer abs that you always dreamt of.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1. NAUKASANA:</strong> A common yoga posture that works wonders on your abs.<br />Method: Lie flat on the ground, with your back on the floor. Raise your upper body and legs to an angle of 30 degrees and hold the posture for 30-40 seconds, then relax. Repeat this asana for 10 times to begin with, graduating to 30 times. Breathe normally all through the work out. &ldquo;Holding onto the posture tightens and contracts your upper and lower abs while repeating the movement tones them up,&rdquo; tells yoga expert Usha Chegappa of Bharat Thakur&rsquo;s Artistic Yoga.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2. USHTRASANA:</strong> It is the counter pose to naukasana.<br />Method: Stand on your knees, with heels facing upwards. Arch your back, placing your hands on your knees one by one. Hold your head behind pushing your belly outwards. Hold this posture for 30 seconds and repeat 30 times.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3. BASIC CRUNCH:</strong> The good old crunch still remains the best exercise to bag the perfect abs.<br />Method: Lie on the floor with your legs off the floor in a right angle. Keep your shoulders just above the floor. Breathe in and bring your knees in towards your chest, while lifting your upper body to an angle of 30 degrees and breathe out while you relax. Repeat this exercise 15-20 times to begin with.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t arch your back. The crunches will help you contract your abdomninal muscles giving them an effective workout,&rdquo; suggests Deanne.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4. BRIDGING:</strong> Stretch till you feel the burn!<br />Method: Lie flat on the floor with your hands resting by your sides, feet flat on the floor, shoulder width apart and knees bent. Now, contract your abdominals, lower back and gluts and slowly lift your midsection to form a bridge from your knees, through your hips to your shoulders. Hold this position for a few seconds, and then slowly lower.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5. LYING TORSO TWISTS:</strong> Twisting motion stretches the oblique muscles.<br />Method: Lie on the floor with knees pulled over your chest. Place a ball between your knees and stretch arms to the sides like an airplane, palms facing up. Contract your abs and twist your hips to the right, bringing knees towards the floor Don&rsquo;t touch the floor, but use your abs to bring your knees back to the start and go to the other side.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>6. CYCLING:</strong> Not on the cycle, but on the floor.<br />Method: Lie on the floor and raise your legs. Make slow pedaling motions with both your legs alternatively. Keep breathing normally. Touch your left elbow to your right knee, then your right elbow to your left knee.<br />&ldquo;The slower and controlled are the motions, more is the pressure exerted on your abs giving better results,&rdquo; explains Deanne.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>7. SIDE PLANK:</strong> targeted to your oblique muscles or side abs.<br />Method: Lie down on your side with elbows supporting your body above the ground. Now lift your body sideways. This will make you feel the stretch on your oblique muscles giving them a good workout. 2-3 sets of 15-20 movements are ideal.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>8. DANCING WONDERS:</strong> Feel the pulse.<br />&ldquo;Stomach muscles are core muscles involved in any kind of dancing. A toned stomach accentuates your moves, while dance movements make your stomach sexy. It&rsquo;s a co-related process,&rdquo; says dance instructor, Nanda Kundu.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The above mentioned abdominal muscles are required to be repeated over a period of time to get desired results. &ldquo;Give sufficient rest between abdominal exercises and sets. Increase the amount of repetitions that you perform each week by two times, until you can comfortably perform 20 repititions of each abdominal exercise,&rdquo; advises Kiran.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/tummy1476355372805.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ecf26734a4ac2d218b21c6","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"flat tummy"},{"text":"flat stomach"},{"text":"ab exercises"},{"text":"cardio exercises"},{"text":"diet"},{"text":"abdominal muscles"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://news.statetimes.in/8-wonder-ways-flat-tummy/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-13T10:43:07.106Z","udate":"2016-10-13T12:48:59.625Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-13T10:42:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57ff653b88b8006a72195a5d","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out9853.mp3","tagsForSearch":"flat tummy,flat stomach,ab exercises,cardio exercises,diet,abdominal muscles","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

While King Ugrasena was a good king, Prince Kamsa was a ruthless tyrant. Now Princess Devaki was to wed a nobleman named Vasudeva.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">Kamsa out of the love he bore for his sister decided to be the bride and groom's charioteer for the day. While Kamsa drove the chariot bearing Devaki and Vasudeva out of the wedding hall, a voice from the heavens boomed informing Kamsa that Devaki's eight <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">child</span> would be his slayer.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">Kamsa being the superstitious type would take no chances. He wanted to strike down Devaki that very moment. Vasudeva intervened, he begged Kamsa not to slay Devaki and show her some mercy. He further promised Kamsa that he would hand over any child born to them, if he would let Devaki live. Now Kamsa not wanting to have the blood of his sister on his hands agreed and instead placed them under house arrest.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">Every time a <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">child</span> was born, the guards would inform Kamsa and he would take the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">child</span> and kill it. Six of Devaki and Vasudev's children met their death this way. It so happened that the seventh <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">child</span> was born at night, and Devaki and Vasudeva seeing the opportunity decided to try to save the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">child</span>.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\"><span class=\"IL_SPAN\">The guards</span> were asleep, so Vasudeva easily slid out of the palace undetected. He went to neighboring Gokul and left the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">child</span> with his second wife Rohini and quickly returned to the palace (this <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">child</span> was named Balrama). In the morning he sent word to Kamsa that the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">child</span> was still born.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">Kamsa was pleased, he knew the next <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">child</span> was prophesized to be his slayer. Not wanting to take chances with the birth of the eight <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">child</span>, Kamsa had Vasudeva and Devaki thrown into the dungeon chained.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">The eight <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">child</span> was born on the eight night of the month of Shravan. It was raining heavily and the skies thundered as if the Gods were trying to pay homage to the new born <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">child</span>. Then the miracle happened, Vasudevas chains fell off and the prison door opened by itself. Vasudeva found <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the guards</span> to be asleep, so he decided that he would escape with the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">child</span> and leave him at his friend Nanda's place in Gokul.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">Picking up the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">child</span>, Vasudeva placed him in a basket. He then carried the basket on his head and made his way to Gokul. Now Gokul was on the opposite bank of the river Yamuna. Because of the thundering and the rain, the river Yamuna was in a state of turmoil. Vasudeva, wondering how he would cross the river prayed for a miracle. Then it happened!. The waters of the Yamuna parted and made way for him. Vasudeva then crossed the Yamuna and reached Gokul.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">On reaching Nanda's house in Gokul, Vasudeva realised that Nanda's wife Yashoda had given birth to a baby girl. While Nanda and Yashoda were asleep, he placed his <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">child</span> in the cradle and took Nanda's daughter instead. He presumed that since it was a baby girl, Kamsa would not kill her. He then made the journey back to Mathura and he took the baby girl with him. As soon as Vasudeva reached the dungeon, the dungeon doors closed behind him and the baby girl started to cry. Awakened by the cries, <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the guards</span> rushed to tell Kamsa of the birth of the eight <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">child</span>.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">Hearing the news, Kamsa rushed to the dungeon and picked up the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">child</span> and was about to dash it to the ground. Vasudeva begged Kamsa not to kill the<span class=\"IL_SPAN\">child</span> as it was only a girl and that a girl could do him no harm. The wicked Kamsa paid no heed and dashed the baby to the floor. As the baby was about to hit <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the floor</span>, it suddenly flew up and told Kamsa that the one who was born to kill him still lives and is in Gokul.&nbsp; Then she disappeared.</span></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/krishna_birth1476356160940.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57936332784f768641802ba8","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"krishna"},{"text":"kamsa"},{"text":"vasudeva"},{"text":"birth"},{"text":"devaki"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57fb6fc4e66f216b816f52ca","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.indiaparenting.com/stories/82_791/krishnas-birth.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-13T10:56:07.453Z","udate":"2016-10-13T12:32:23.263Z","expirydate":"2017-02-01T10:51:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-13T10:51:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57ff684733dc432310812447","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out8762.mp3","tagsForSearch":"krishna,kamsa,vasudeva,birth,devaki","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

One day, three great sages paid a visit to this city as Krishna's guests. And one day, during their stay, the youngsters of the Royal family got into a state of intoxication and dressed up Krishna's <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">son</span> Shamva as a woman who needed to be blessed with a <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">son</span>.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">They took him to the three sages and asked them to predict the birth and future of the son of the disguised Shamva. But truly holy men are seldom deceived. And these wise <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">men</span> at once realised the joke that was being played on them. Needless to say they were furious and angrily predicted that within twenty - four hours this man would go into labour and deliver, not a <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">son</span> but an iron thunder bolt which would be the cause of destruction of the entire Yadu race.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">They then went to the palace to inform Krishna of their curse. Now Krishna being the Lord of the universe could easily have nullified or withdrawn their curse but he had too much respect for the words of holy <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">men</span>.&nbsp; So he quietly accepted the news.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The following day as was predicted, Shamva gave birth to an iron thunder bolt which was promptly ground to a powder and thrown into the sea in an attempt to avert the tragedy. Thereafter intoxicating substances and drinks were completely banned from this territory, as everyone knew that this was the real cause of such unruly, irresponsible behaviour and their oncoming fate.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">&nbsp;But still the curse of the holy <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">men</span> hung over the heads of the Yadavas as a dark cloud and ominous signs were noticed everywhere. The whole city was infested by a troublesome group of rats and mice and the sun would set in the middle of the day. The freshest of food would spoil easily and cows gave birth to asses and asses to elephants.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">&nbsp;A blanket of frustration and despair spread over the Yadavas as they indulged themselves in unruly behaviour. Brahmins and elders were being treated with utmost disrespect and couples started indulging in adulterous behaviour.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">&nbsp;Krishna realised that complete destruction was inevitable and so decided to hasten the process. He advised the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">men</span> to take their entire families to the seashore to bathe in the sea. As they headed out they were witness to a few more ominous signs. First Lord Krishna's discus was swallowed by the sky and then his chariot and horses sped away over the ocean.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">On reaching the seashore, the families were all provided with food and drink and once again indulged themselves to the point of destruction. A fight ensued in which Krishna's <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">son</span> was killed. At this point, the Lord picked out a few blades of grass and turned them into weapons that destroyed quite a number of the tribe. Seeing him do this many others also picked out the grass that turned into weapons made out of iron and began killing each other in their fit of intoxication. All in all, five- hundred thousand people were killed and only four survived. One was the Lord himself and the other was his brother Balram.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">After this Balram retired to the forest to practice meditation and yoga and Krishna returned to Dwarka to say good-bye to his father as he knew that he was not going to survive much longer. He also sent one of the survivors to the Pandavas to come and take charge of the widows and children of those who had been killed. He then went on to join Balram in the forest.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">On reaching the forest, he witnessed Balram's ascension into the higher realms of heaven where he was being received by the gods. After this he wandered about immersed in deep thought while he finally began to accept his destiny. In his younger days, Sage Durvasa had cursed him saying that would die of a wound in his left foot. The sage had been offended for some reason and had cursed young Krishna in a fit of anger.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Lord Krishna</span> now decided that it was time for the curse to take effect and so sat down to meditate while exposing his left foot.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">A hunter soon approached and mistook the Lord for a deer. And as was predicted he shot him in his left foot. On realising his grave error he was filled with remorse and grief. But <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Lord Krishna</span> consoled him and asked him not to be scared or sorry as these were the ways of destiny.&nbsp; These were the great Lord's last words on earth.</span></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/passing_on_of_krishna1476356691027.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57936332784f768641802ba8","publisherSectionName":"Indiaparenting","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"dwarka"},{"text":"lord krishna"},{"text":"balram"},{"text":"shamva"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57fb6fc4e66f216b816f52ca","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.indiaparenting.com/stories/82_2261/the-passing-on-of-lord-krishna.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-13T11:04:57.712Z","udate":"2016-10-13T12:32:02.980Z","expirydate":"2017-02-02T11:00:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-13T11:00:00.000Z","publiseherSectionId":"","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57ff6a59c87f523c372239e1","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out3723.mp3","tagsForSearch":"dwarka,lord krishna,balram,shamva","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Thereafter, the safety and efficacy of the therapy, dose schedule, and protocol for administration of HESCs and therapy schedule were established in a pilot study conducted on 72 patients,\" said the study.<br /><br />With the success of pilot study, another study was done on 108 patients with spinal cord injury that verified the safety and efficacy of HESC in them.<br /><br />Medical Sciences say a spinal cord injury can be any damage to the spinal cord that changes its function, temporary or permanently.<br /><br />There have been several strategies to improve neurological recovery, such as surgical intervention, physiotherapy, and pharmacological interventions, but none of these have proven to be effective.<br /><br />Following the two success stories, one more study was conducted on 226 patients with spinal cord injuries. The study was performed under proper supervision of a team of physicians that included external consultants and validated by an external clinical research organisation.<br /><br />According to the study reports, after confirmation of diagnosis, the patients were tested for hypersensitivity reactions with HESCs (0.05 mL HESC injected subcutaneously).<br /><br />The study consisted of three treatment phases with gap phases in between so that the HESCs could grow, repair, and regenerate the affected part.<br /><br />\"After the hypersensitivity testing, the patients entered the treatment phase, T1, T2, T3. Each treatment phase lasted 4-6 weeks and was 4-8 months apart. The physicians regularly administered the HESCs during the treatment. No immune-suppressants were given to the patients. In addition to HESC therapy, all the patients received physiotherapy and occupational therapy,\" said the study.<br /><br />The rehabilitation focused on overall improvement of the patient and mobilisation of the patient was performed using different ambulatory aids.<br /><br />\"The findings and results of the research showed dramatic changes in each phase.

When Kamsa heard about Krishna, he was sure that Krishna was Devaki's eight born child, born to destroy him. He, in turn, planned to invite Krishna to Mathura and have him killed. He summoned an old minister by the name of Akrura and sent him to Gokul with an invitation. Now Akrura was wise. He knew the real story of Krishna. That Krishna was a divine being born to kill Kamsa. He also knew that Nanda and Yashoda were not really Krishna's parents. On arriving in Gokul, Akrura told Krishna and his parents everything. Nanda and Yashoda were horrified, they wondered how a teenager like Krishna could take on a warrior like Kamsa. But Krishna insisted on going and he and Balrama left for Mathura.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\">In the mean time, back in Mathura, Kamsa was thinking of ways of having Krishna killed. He asked an elephant trainer to have a mad elephant trample Krishna.

Krishna then lifted the crown from Kamsa's severed head and walked towards the dungeon where King Ugrasena was imprisoned, freed him and offered him the crown. King Ugrasena was touched that Krishna would make him King again. Krishna then freed his parents Devaki and Vasudeva and had a joyous re-union with them.</span></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/krishna_in_mathura1476358257463.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57936332784f768641802ba8","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"mathura"},{"text":"krishna"},{"text":"kamsa"},{"text":"balrama"},{"text":"gokul"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57fb6fc4e66f216b816f52ca","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.indiaparenting.com/stories/82_793/krishna-returns-to-mathura.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-13T11:31:03.972Z","udate":"2016-10-13T12:31:27.311Z","expirydate":"2017-02-01T11:27:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-13T11:27:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57ff70781345ff415e33d4ff","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6287.mp3","tagsForSearch":"mathura,krishna,kamsa,balrama,gokul","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Surya being pleased with Satrajit's devotion appeared before him and gifted him the Syamantaka gem. The Syamantaka gem's specialty was that it could magically produce eight measures of gold a day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Satrajit became a really wealthy man. Krishna then approached Satrajit and told him that he should share the gem with the other people of Dwarka and give it to King Ugrasena. Satrajit declined saying that the jewel belonged to him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">A few days later, Satrajit's brother Prasena wore the jewel as a necklace and went out on a hunt. He climbed a tree waiting for some game, a lion came by and just as Prasena was about to shoot it, a snake, which dropped from the branch above, surprised him. Now Prasena was startled and he fell from the tree. As he was falling, the necklace with the Syamantaka gem got caught in a branch and Prasena hung by the neck, and was killed instantly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Now <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the lion</span> below, being attracted to the glow of <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the gem</span>, picked it up and carried it away. As <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the lion</span> walked away with <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the gem</span>, Jambavan the king of the bears saw him. Being seduced by the glow of <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the gem</span>, he attacked <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the lion</span> and killed it and took <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the gem</span> to his cave and gifted it to his infant son.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Prasena did not return to Dwarka and people were wondering what had happened to him. Satrajit suspected that <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Krishna</span> might have killed Prasena in order to attain <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the gem</span>. <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Krishna</span>, in order to prove his innocence, gathered a search party and went into the forest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">A few hours later, they found Prasena's body. <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Krishna</span> noticed lion tracks around the body and assumed that a lion must have killed Prasena. On following the lion tracks, they came across the body of the dead lion. <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Krishna</span>noticed that <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the lion</span> had the marks of a bear's claws and noticed that there were bear tracks around the body. On following the bear tracks <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Krishna</span>reached Jambavan's cave. <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Krishna</span> sensing the danger ordered the rest of the party to stay outside while he entered the cave alone. <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Krishna</span> found Jambavan's son playing with the Syamantaka gem. Frightened by the stranger, Jambavan's son let out a wail that alerted Jambavan. Now Jambavan thought someone was attacking his child and attacked <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Krishna</span>.<span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Krishna</span> fought Jambavan for twenty-eight days after which Jambavan recognised Krishna's divinity and surrendered to him. Along with <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the gem</span>, Jambavan offered <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Krishna</span> his daughter Jambavati's hand in marriage. This<span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Krishna</span> accepted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Krishna</span> then returned to Dwarka with the Syamantaka gem and his new bride.<span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Krishna</span> returned <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the gem</span> to its rightful owner Satrajit who by then was ashamed of accusing <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Krishna</span>. In order to make up for his accusations and show his good will towards <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Krishna</span>, Satrajit offered his daughter Satyabhama to <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Krishna</span>.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">But Satyabhama already had three suitors - Akrura, Kritavarma and Shatadhanwa. They were angered by the fact that Satrajit have given Satyabhama to <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Krishna</span> and not to one of them. Shatadhanwa in his rage killed Satrajit while he slept and stole the Syamantaka gem from him.

When Kamsa heard about Krishna, he was sure that Krishna was Devaki's eight born child, born to destroy him. He, in turn, planned to invite Krishna to Mathura and have him killed. He summoned an old minister by the name of Akrura and sent him to Gokul with an invitation. Now Akrura was wise. He knew the real story of Krishna. That Krishna was a divine being born to kill Kamsa. He also knew that Nanda and Yashoda were not really Krishna's parents. On arriving in Gokul, Akrura told Krishna and his parents everything. Nanda and Yashoda were horrified, they wondered how a teenager like Krishna could take on a warrior like Kamsa. But Krishna insisted on going and he and Balrama left for Mathura.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\">In the mean time, back in Mathura, Kamsa was thinking of ways of having Krishna killed.

The Syamantaka gem's specialty was that it could magically produce eight measures of gold a day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Satrajit became a really wealthy man. Krishna then approached Satrajit and told him that he should share the gem with the other people of Dwarka and give it to King Ugrasena. Satrajit declined saying that the jewel belonged to him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">A few days later, Satrajit's brother Prasena wore the jewel as a necklace and went out on a hunt. He climbed a tree waiting for some game, a lion came by and just as Prasena was about to shoot it, a snake, which dropped from the branch above, surprised him. Now Prasena was startled and he fell from the tree. As he was falling, the necklace with the Syamantaka gem got caught in a branch and Prasena hung by the neck, and was killed instantly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Now <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the lion</span> below, being attracted to the glow of <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the gem</span>, picked it up and carried it away.

Being seduced by the glow of <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the gem</span>, he attacked <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the lion</span> and killed it and took <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the gem</span> to his cave and gifted it to his infant son.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Prasena did not return to Dwarka and people were wondering what had happened to him. Satrajit suspected that <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Krishna</span> might have killed Prasena in order to attain <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the gem</span>. <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Krishna</span>, in order to prove his innocence, gathered a search party and went into the forest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">A few hours later, they found Prasena's body. <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Krishna</span> noticed lion tracks around the body and assumed that a lion must have killed Prasena.

On following the bear tracks <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Krishna</span>reached Jambavan's cave. <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Krishna</span> sensing the danger ordered the rest of the party to stay outside while he entered the cave alone. <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Krishna</span> found Jambavan's son playing with the Syamantaka gem. Frightened by the stranger, Jambavan's son let out a wail that alerted Jambavan. Now Jambavan thought someone was attacking his child and attacked <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Krishna</span>.<span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Krishna</span> fought Jambavan for twenty-eight days after which Jambavan recognised Krishna's divinity and surrendered to him.

Over half a century later, the Swedish Academy acknowledged Bob Dylan's message by making him the first songwriter to be conferred the Nobel Prize for Literature.<br /><br />The Nobel \"for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition\" caps a long illustrious career for Dylan, who turned 75 this May, and is already the recipient of 11 Grammies (including for Lifetime Achievement), a Golden Globe, an Oscar, a place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, a special Pulitzer Prize citation for \"his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power\" and the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama in 2012.<br /><br />Dylan seemed to embody, for popular music, Karl Marx's dictum that philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways but the point, however, is to change it. Be it the iconic \"Blowing in the Wind\" (excerpted above), \"Masters of War\" (\"You that build all the guns/You that build the death planes/You that build the big bombs/You that hide behind walls/You that hide behind desks..\") and more, his ballads not only became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements, but can still articulate deep concern at global and social conditions, both then and now. <br /><br />He, however, vehemently disputed that he was a spokesman for the 1960s youth while many of his most famous works don't seemed restricted to the age when they came out -- or the setting. Such as \"The Times They Are A-Changin\" with its \"Come mothers and fathers/Throughout the land/And don't criticize/What you can't understand/Your sons and your daughters/Are beyond your command/Your old road is rapidly agin'/Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand/For the times they are a-changin\" seems as valid anywhere now as in 1960s America.<br /><br />Born Robert Allan Zimmerman in Minnesota on May 24, 1941, to a Jewish family with its roots in Tsarist Russia, he displayed an interest in music right from his school days and, in 1961, dropped out of university for a full-time music career. He also changed his surname to Dylan, in homage to Welsh poet Dylan Thomas.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"http://www.ians.in/stories/2016/Oct/13/Bd1a.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" /><br /><br />Though his first album \"Bob Dylan\" (1962) with renditions of popular existing folk and gospel hits remained unnoticed, it was his second \"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\", with 9 of its 11 tracks written by him, and then \"The Times They Are A-Changin\", all self-written, that catapulted him to recognition and renown.<br /><br />Besides rights and peace, they also chronicled various social injustices - such as \"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\" about the unprovoked senseless killing of a black hotel barmaid by a young well-connected white man socialite, who gets off lightly, but his vivid, unsettling and even surreal lyrics leave a marked impression. <br /><br />Take the aftermath of nuclear war: \"...I saw a white ladder all covered with water/I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken/I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children/And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard/And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall\" or on the \"Red Scare\" of hidden communists: \"I wus lookin' high an' low for them Reds everywhere/I wus lookin' in the sink an' underneath the chair/I looked way up my chimney hole/I even looked deep down inside my toilet bowl/They got away...\" (\"Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues\").<br /><br />Dylan, who is still active, kept on reinventing himself, moving across the whole spectrum of musical genres -- rock and roll, blues, country, gospel, jazz -- while once riling the establishment of folk music (his original) by performing with an electric band, and then even being part of pop band The Travelling Willburys comprising, among others, Roy \"Pretty Woman\" Orbison and former Beatles member George Harrison. It is, however, his initial record that makes up his abiding legend.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/Bd21476371613839.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57ff6b52c87f523c372239f7","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"bob dylan"},{"text":"nobel prize for literature"},{"text":"singer"},{"text":"golden globe"},{"text":"oscar"},{"text":"grammies"},{"text":"popular music"},{"text":"american culture"},{"text":"lyrics"},{"text":"presidential medal of freedom"},{"text":"poetry"},{"text":"robert allan zimmerman"},{"text":"jewish"},{"text":"poet dylan thomas"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd191afb61356b41a1bb48","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.ians.in/index.php?param=news/C-1-835855&storytype=special","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-13T14:27:34.070Z","udate":"2016-12-17T10:54:49.340Z","expirydate":"2017-10-13T14:27:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-13T14:27:00.000Z","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"57ff99d6354a1136a62db161","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out8164.mp3","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"bob dylan,nobel prize for literature,singer,golden globe,oscar,grammies,popular music,american culture,lyrics,presidential medal of freedom,poetry,robert allan zimmerman,jewish,poet dylan thomas","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

The king of the demons with ten heads and twenty hands makes <em>Hindu</em> mythology really interesting. <em>Ravana</em>was born to parents by name <em>Visrawasa</em> and <em>Kaikasi</em>. He had two brothers with names <em>Kumbhakarna</em> and <em>Vibhishana</em>. <br /><br />It is believed that <em>Ravana</em> was the most dreadful creature ever born. His childhood was responsible to make him whatever he was. When he was a child, people were terrified of a child having ten heads and dark complexion. Let us once again go back in time of mythology and supernatural powers to get the glimpse of the life of deadly demon and incredibly scholar persona known as <em>Ravana</em>.</span></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><strong>How Ravana got his name...</strong> <br /><br /><em>Ravana</em>'s real name was <em>Dasamukha</em> which literally means one who carries ten heads. <em>Valmiki's <a href=\"http://www.indiaparenting.com/indianculture/festivals/fest043.shtml\">Ramayana</a></em> narrates the story about how <em>Dasamukha</em> got the name <em>Ravana</em>. Once <em>Ravana</em> infuriated the great monkey king <em>Vaali</em> who was praying on the mountain. Agitated <em>Vaali</em> trapped <em>Ravana</em>. <em>Ravana</em> kept howling until Valli released him from the trapping. Since then people forgot<em>Dasamukha</em> and remembered <em>Ravana</em>.</span></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><br /><strong>Intellectual and scholar demon</strong> <br /><br />Though <em>Ravana</em> is looked upon as a cruel demon who annoyed the innocent, he is also known as a great intellectual in the history of<em>Hindu</em> mythology. Under the guidance of his father, <em>Ravana</em> grasped vast knowledge. He learned sacred texts like <em>Vedas</em>. He mastered holy scripts. <em>Ravana</em> himself was a <em>Brahmin</em> but he learned the skills and techniques of <em>Kshatriyas</em>.</span></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><br /><strong>Devotee of lord Shiva</strong> <br /><br />The demon that was well known for his evil powers had great faith in almighty. He was a believer of the supernatural beings. <em>Ravana</em>was a faithful devotee of lord <em>Shiva</em>, one of the incarnations of lord<em>Vishnu</em>. While possessed with obsession to manifest <em>Lanka, Ravana c</em>onfronted <em>Shiva. Ravana</em> tried to move on the mountain <em>Kailash</em>, the home of the lord <em>Shiva</em>. <br /><br />In anger Lord <em>Shiva</em> punished <em>Ravana</em> by pressing him under his little toe. <em>Ravana</em> howled and danced to please lord <em>Shiva</em>. Then on<em>Ravana</em> worshipped lord <em>Shiva</em> with unconditional devotion. During this chance meeting with <em>Shiva, Ravana</em> composed <em>Shiva tandava stotram</em>.</span></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><br /><strong>The gruesome side of Ravana</strong> <br /><br /><em>Ravana</em> had many wives but <em>Mandodari</em> is renowned as she was famous for her elegance and beauty. She was intelligent. Apart from legal wives <em>Ravana</em> was believed to have physical relations with many other women whom he had captured in the battles. There is a mention of the episodes in the <a href=\"http://www.indiaparenting.com/raisingchild/data/raisingchild308.shtml\"><em>Ramayana</em></a> that he forced several women; amongst them was a sage-woman <em>Vedavati</em>. <br /><br /><em>Vedavati</em> who was infatuated with the charisma of lord <em>Vishnu</em>, ended her life after losing her chastity. <em>Ravana</em> also tried to abuse<em>Rambha</em>, an <em>apasara</em> engaged to <em>Kubera</em>'s (the god of wealth) son. After learning <em>Ravana</em>'s advances, <em>Kubera</em> cursed him that if he tried to force himself upon any women, all his heads would fall off. This is one of the reasons why he did not touch <em>Sita</em> when she was in his abduction.</span></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><strong>The king of demons</strong> <br /></span></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><em>Ravana</em> was obsessed with the thought of conquering <em>Lanka. Ravana</em> performed tapas for many years to please <em>Brahma</em>, the god of creation. Seeing his dedication <em>Brahma</em> bestowed him boons. <em>Brahma</em> granted his wishes to be unbeatable by gods and other powers. After getting the control of divine power, he conquered <em>Lanka</em>. <br /><br />In his tenure, <em>Lanka</em> was a prosperous and wealthy kingdom. He leaded <em>Lanka</em> with his skills and he was considered one of the great monarchs. Under his ruling people in Lanka were living affluent lives. It is said that they actually owned gold vessels to consume their food. <em>Ravana</em> was admired for his huge knowledge of weapons and sorcery.</span></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><strong>Ravana kidnaps Sita</strong> <br /><br /><em>Ravana</em>'s sister <a href=\"http://www.indiaparenting.com/indianculture/festivals/fest054.shtml\"><em>Shurpanakha</em></a> was fascinated by <em>Rama</em> and she proposed him for marriage. <em>Rama</em> refused her proposal as he was already married to <em>Sita</em>. Then Shurpanakha pleaded <em>Laxman, Rama</em>'s brother to marry her. In a fit of rage <em>Laxman</em> chopped off her nose. <em>Ravana</em> got angry and to take revenge he kidnapped<em>Sita</em>. <br /><br /><em>Sita</em> was in his captive for nearly a year. Later she had to go through <em>Agnipariksha</em> to prove her chastity. Some facts in the mythology say that during her abduction, <em>Ravana</em> persuaded her to be his wife but never touched her. Other facts say that he kidnapped <em>Sita</em> only to take revenge of <em>Laxman</em>'s behavior towards his sister. <br /><br />When <em>Hanuman</em> (<em>Rama</em>'s great devotee) was on his way back from<em>Lanka</em> to inform <em>Rama </em>about <em>Sita</em>'s whereabouts, the demons in the<em>Lanka</em> set his tail on fire. But with his powers Hanuman increased the size of his tail and <em>Lanka</em> was burnt. <em>Rama</em> with the help of<em>Hanuman</em> set off to <em>Lanka</em> once he got to know about the <em>Sita</em>'s kidnap.</span></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><strong>Decline of Ravana</strong> <br /><br />As <em>Ravana</em> was unbeatable, <em>Rama</em> had to acquire a special weapon to kill <em>Ravana</em>. <em>Laxman</em> got severely injured in the battle but he was saved by the magical herbs from the Himalayas. Finally Rama defeated <em>Ravana</em> and that was the end of the empire of <em>Ravana. Ravana</em> lost his life and his virtues because of his <em>Karmas</em>. His ego was solely responsible for his devastation. <br /><br />On the day of <a href=\"http://www.indiaparenting.com/indianculture/festivals/fest005.shtml\"><em>Dassera</em></a><em> Ravana</em>'s effigies are burnt to signify the power of the good over evil.

Carried out by a team from the University of Edinburgh, the research analysed 60 studies for the review to look at which factors show at least a moderate -- if not strong -- link with increasing the risk of dementia.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Genetic factors and lifestyle factors such as high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, obesity, depression and low educational attainment are already known to be associated with dementia. However they still leave around a third of dementia risk unexplained.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After reviewing studies that have looked at environmental risk factors, the researchers found that a lack of vitamin D -- produced by the body through exposure to sunlight -- was strongly linked with the condition, as was exposure to air pollution and some types of pesticide.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Excessive levels of minerals found in drinking water may also be associated with the condition, however the evidence was mixed. The researchers also noted that the studies included varied in both size and quality and therefore further research is needed to confirm the associations found.

{"_id":"5800676bae9d51056b0a5562","title":"Diabetes deaths up by 50% in 11 years","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e4358d3f458eaf4410d","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With a genetic predisposition brought to the fore by changing lifestyles, deaths due to diabetes increased 50 per cent in India between 2005 and 2015, and is now the seventh-most common cause of death in the country, up from 11th rank in 2005, according to data published by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD).</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ischemic heart disease continues to be the highest cause of death, followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infection, diarrhoeal diseases and tuberculosis. In 2015, 346,000 people died of diabetes, which caused 3.3 per cent of all deaths that year, with an annual increase of 2.7 per cent from 1990, according to the GBD study.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nearly 26 people die of diabetes per 100,000 population; diabetes is also one of the top causes of disability and accounts for 2.4 per cent of the disability-adjusted life-years lost (sum of years lost due to disability or premature death due to the disease). There are 69.1 million people with diabetes in India, the second-highest number in the world after China, which has 109 million people with diabetes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of these, 36 million cases remain undiagnosed, according to a 2015 Diabetes Atlas released by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). Nearly nine per cent in the age group of 20-79 have diabetes. The figures are alarming since diabetes is a chronic disease that not just affects the pancreas' ability to produce insulin but impacts the entire body. Complications caused due to diabetes include heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, vision loss and neuropathy or nerve damage leading to leg amputation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unlike other countries, where a majority of people with diabetes are over 60 years old, the prevalence in India is among the 40-59 years age group, affecting productivity of the population. \"Diabetes strikes Indians a decade earlier than the world,\" Anoop Misra, chairman, Fortis Centre of Excellence for Diabetes, Metabolic Diseases and Endocrinology, New Delhi, told IndiaSpend. \"This causes reduced productivity, increased absenteeism in working population and gives more time for complications to arise.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Indians are especially predisposed to diabetes due to social and genetic reasons. Peculiar genetic composition of Indians known as \"Asian Indian Phenotype\" makes them appear thin but with fat depositions around their internal organs. It makes them prone to greater abdominal fat, insulin resistance, higher levels of bad fat and increased chances of suffering from diabetes and coronary artery disease.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lifestyle changes with reduced physical activity and carbohydrate-rich diets, along with environmental factors, are increasing India's diabetes burden, IndiaSpend reported in June 2015. It is estimated that diabetes patients in urban areas spend Rs 10,000 and patients in rural areas spend Rs 6,260 every year on treatment, according to a 2013 study published by The Association of Physicians of India.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since most of the healthcare cost is borne out of pocket in India, those in lower economic groups have to bear the greatest burden. Urban poor spend as much as 34 per cent while rural poor spend 27 per cent of their income on diabetes treatment, the study found. India is predicted to have 123 million diabetes cases aged between 20 and 79 by 2040, according to estimates by IDF. \"We need a national campaign on the level of pulse polio to tackle diabetes, it is soon going to be a problem bigger than TB, HIV and malaria together,\" Misra said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though diabetes features in the National Health Mission's National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke for district-level intervention to prevent non-communicable diseases, it needs to do more to screen, create awareness and monitor and treat the disease to stem the tide.

Upon check-up, it was found that Nandhini was suffering from a disorder called Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), which was not diagnosed earlier as she had been overweight almost all her life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr Chandana Lakkireddi, Fertility Consultant, Nova IVI Fertility, Hyderabad said &ldquo;As we observe World Obesity Day on October 11, we aim to spread awareness on the adverse effects of obesity on young men and women in India. In our center in Hyderabad, we see that over 20 per cent of the patients who come for infertility treatment are either overweight or obese. Many of them are young, between 25 and 35 years of age. While obesity affects human health in many ways, majorly resulting in cardiovascular diseases, its effects on infertility are often overlooked.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sudden weight gain and abnormal growth of facial hair and acne are some of the major signs of PCOS in women. However, many women fail to relate those symptoms to PCOS. PCOS is a common disorder that is caused by hormonal imbalance in the body, thereby disrupting the ovulation process and eventually leading to infertility when not diagnosed and treated at the right time. It is crucial for women with PCOS to keep their weight in check.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Obesity is widely determined by the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person which is calculated as the average ratio of one&rsquo;s height and weight. Higher the BMI, higher will be the risk of becoming obese. In men, obesity can result in reduced sperm count, lowered levels of testosterone, physical constraints, reduced libido, hypertension and uncontrolled diabetes which deteriorates the quality of semen.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;While infertility is a pre conceived notion attached to women among many in the society, obesity is a factor that breaks the stereotype and reveals how men too can be infertile. Male factor is seen in 40 to 45 per cent of the infertile patients we see in Hyderabad.&rdquo; Dr Chandana Lakkireddi added. Obesity is increasingly becoming a characteristic of many people in urban areas, more than being a disease alone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The lack of exercise, increased consumption of junk food and alcohol, binge eatingand insufficient sleep are some of the many reasons for obesity. Obesity can lead to other disorders such as poor heart functions, high cholesterol and hypertension, apart from infertility. &ldquo;Obese women often tend to face complications with not only in natural conception but also in assisted reproduction techniques that we carry out.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We educate our patients about the importance of having their weight in control so that they have a healthy reproductive system.Regular exercise and replacing junk food with healthy food can go a long way in fulfilling the dream of being a parent without any hurdle.&rdquo; said Dr Chandana Lakkireddi.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Apart from ensuring a balanced diet, one should also regularly get their weight checked to see if their BMI is in the right range. It is necessary for both men and women to maintain a healthy lifestyle, with regular physical workouts and proper food intake to live the dream of healthy parenthood.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/obese1476421737048.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babc1e73031e7ec856e9a3","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"obese youth"},{"text":"polycystic ovarian syndrome"},{"text":"nova ivi fertility"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Health/2016-10-13/Obese-youth-at-higher-risk-of-infertility/258538","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-14T05:09:10.740Z","udate":"2016-10-14T06:44:38.484Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-14T05:08:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"58006876ec385d365bd6c980","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out9956.mp3","tagsForSearch":"obese youth,polycystic ovarian syndrome,nova ivi fertility","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Most people would connect arthritis to old age, and this is not a grave misconception as we often hear and relate the conditions with the elderly. This is a misconception and people belonging to any age can have arthritis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Arthritis affects over 15 per cent of the people in the country and has a higher prevalence than many of the well-known diseases. It presents itself in various modes and is common in &nbsp;young adults. Dr B Chakradhar Reddy sheds light on the causes and symptoms specifically related to children and young adults in India.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sports injuries: The trauma of sports inquiries can cause osteoarthritis in adults of any age. Common injuries that may lead to osteoarthritis include: torn cartilage, dislocated joints and ligament injuries.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Electronic Gadgets: The amount of time the younger generation spends on mobile phones computers and other gaming devices, they become prone to developing osteoarthritis of the wrists and fingers. The postures while using these devices can cause joint disorders of the spine and hip. These forms of arthritis are becoming more common these days.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Autoimmune disorders: One of the most common forms of arthritis in children and young adults is autoimmune disorders. Our immune system helps to fight off harmful bacteria and viruses, but in the case of autoimmune disorders, the immune system tends to attack some of the healthy cells and tissues that can cause infections and inflammation of joints.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Obesity: Although Arthritis affects people of all ages, genders, and sizes, the risk increases if one is overweight. Excess body weight places additional stress on the joints, especially knees, hips, and back. It can also cause cartilage damage, which is the hallmark of osteoarthritis.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Smoking: Cigarette smoking increases the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, particularly if you have a genetic predisposition for developing the disease. Smoking also appears to be associated with greater disease severity.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Heredity: One is more likely to suffer from arthritis symptoms if their parents, grandparents, or siblings have arthritis. Arthritis tends to run in the family, especially if one has genetic joint defects. The most common symptoms of osteoarthritis is pain, swelling, morning stiffness and difficulty in doing daily activities.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It increases with age and it is recommended to see the specialist doctor as early as possible. Depending upon the stage of arthritis the doctor will advise treatment which could be medicines, exercises or minimally invasive knee surgery.

Blood flow is slower than normal, which compromises the blood flow to the vital organs of the body like kidneys, liver and brain&nbsp;leading to the malfunction of these organs,\" Subhash Chandra, Chairman, Cardiology, BLK Super Speciality Hospital, New Delhi, told IANS.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Heart failure is not similar to a heart attack and it is important for people to understand the difference, the experts said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Heart failure refers to the condition wherein the blood pumping capacity of the heart is reduced. Heart attack is secondary to blocked coronary circulation. Blood supply to muscles of heart is cut or drastically reduced,\" Salil Shirodkar, Interventional Cardiologist at Mumbai's Nanavati Super Speciality Hospital, told IANS.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to the experts, two types of heart dysfunctions can lead to heart failure -- systolic heart failure and diastolic failure.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Systolic heart failure is the most common cause of heart failure and occurs when the heart is weak and enlarged and the muscle of the left ventricle loses some of its ability to contract or shorten, whereas diastolic failure is when the muscle becomes stiff and loses some of its ability to relax.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a result, the affected chamber has trouble filling with blood during the rest period that occurs after each heartbeat.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Heart failure is caused by many conditions that damage the heart muscle, including coronary artery disease (CAD), heart attack, cardiomyopathy disease of a heart muscle.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The main causes of heart failure are blockages in the blood vessels supplying blood to the heart leading to heart attacks, weakness of the heart muscles either because of unknown reasons or because of some infection, drugs, diabetes, etc.; high blood pressure is also one of the main causes of heart failure,\" Vishal Rastogi, Head of Department, Heart Failure Clinic, Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, told IANS.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Heart failure can also occur with heart defects present at birth or congenital heart defects.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Children with congenital heart defects often have slower growth and development and they may be smaller than other children of the same age. They may also have life-long problems with learning difficulties,\" Shantala Vadeyar, Group Medical Director, Department of Fetal and Maternal Medicine, Cloudnine Group of Hospitals, Mumbai, told IANS.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Early symptoms of heart failure are fatigue and shortness of breath. These affect daily activities such as walking, climbing stairs or carrying groceries.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The warning signs associated with heart failure includes acute shortness of breath, coughing or wheezing, accumulation of excess fluid in body tissues, tiredness, fatigue, nausea, lack of appetite and an elevated heart rate.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Basically your heart tries to compensate for its lack of strength by beating more often to help deliver a sufficient amount of blood to your tissues and organs,\" Chandra explained.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, heart failure can be prevented by having proper diet, daily exercise, swimming, jogging, adequate sleep, and minimizing stress and tension.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Diabetic or hypertensive patients should be more careful; they should always take the medications as prescribed by the doctor.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"As of now there's no known cure for heart failure, but there are steps that can be taken to prevent a weak heart from getting weaker,\" Chandra said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Controlling hypertension, regular medical follow-up with doctors, non-smoking and alcohol consumption in moderation and lifestyle modifications with an effective mix and match of diet, along with daily exercise, are the key to preventing heart failure,\" Shirodkar added.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For children with congenital heart defects, it is not all bad news, as some of these defects may be treatable.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Many congenital heart defects (CHD) can also be treated and children can lead a normal life. It is important that CHD should be detected in the developing baby so that doctors can counsel parents to help them prepare for possible outcomes and surgical interventions,\" Vadeyar said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Surgery may also sometimes prevent further damage to the heart and improve its functioning.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>- By Vivek Singh Chauhan<br /></em></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/heart1476422473425.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babc1e73031e7ec856e9a3","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"heart failure"},{"text":"health"},{"text":"heart"},{"text":"heart attack"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Health/2016-10-13/Heart-failure-not-as-life-threatening-as-heart-attack/258520","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-14T05:21:28.657Z","udate":"2016-10-14T06:45:26.721Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-14T05:20:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"58006b58ae9d51056b0a5592","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out5436.mp3","tagsForSearch":"heart failure,health,heart,heart attack","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Eat every two to three hours by including three main meals and three snacks and eat within one hour of waking up.<br /><br />* Don&rsquo;t drink your calories: Cutting liquid calories can be more effective for weight loss than cutting the same number of calories from your solid food intake. <br /><br />* Break the fast: Your body responds to not eating for hours by slowing down its metabolic rate. By eating breakfast you wake up your metabolism and get your <br />engine humming, burning those calories you need to burn to lose weight. Research suggests that people who eat breakfast are less likely to overeat later in the day. <br /><br />* Start your meal with slow foods: Foods which take a long time to eat or a long time to digest or both can be a good start to the day. By eating slow foods first i.e. chewy, crunchy or heavy watery foods such as soup, salad and vegetables you will automatically consume your calories more slowly and feel satiated with fewer calories.<br /><br />* Three bites rule for dessert: Instead of pairing your favourite treats with guilt, indulge smartly. It&rsquo;s always better to have sweets in between meals instead of having them right after a main meal. If you just can&rsquo;t let go of the temptation, then restrict yourself to only three bites.<br /><br />* Grocery shop on a full stomach: Going to a grocery store on empty stomach makes you pick foods high in salt, sugar and fat. Shop from a prepared list so impulse buying is kept to a minimum. <br /><br />Eating right starts with stocking healthy food in your pantry or refrigerator.<br /><br />* Replace your plate: A two-inch difference in your plate size can make you eat 22 per cent fewer calories.<br /><br />* With glasses, think slender: We tend to pour 30 per cent more into a wide glass than into a slender one.<br /><br />* Use the half-plate rule: For lunch or dinner, half the plate should be vegetable and the other half should be protein and carbs.</p>","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baabc5ecbc9256e95c1763","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"lifestyle"},{"text":"health tips"},{"text":"nutrition"},{"text":"fitness"},{"text":"healthy weight"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/575599/little-changes-bigger-benefits.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-14T05:39:23.781Z","udate":"2016-10-14T06:46:12.237Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-14T05:38:00.000Z","title_or_id":"","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"58006f8b24f5e1084b2004d5","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out1556.mp3","tagsForSearch":"lifestyle,health tips,nutrition,fitness,healthy weight","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"580070c004092b20a554d07b","title":"The Golden Goose","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8ff4af76df6bbfd6adfd","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">Once upon a time there lived a queen in the city of Benaras. Her name was Khema and she was the wife of <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">King</span> Bahuputtaka, which means 'father of many sons'. One night, the Queen had a dream of a beautiful golden goose that spoke with great wisdom, almost as if he was a sage. She told her husband that she desperately wanted to see a bird just like the one that she had seen in her dream.</span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">So the King asked his ministers to find out all that they could about a bird such as this. He was told that such a bird did exist but was extremely rare and difficult to find. They advised him to build a beautiful lake on the outskirts of Benaras so that he may attract such rare and lovely creatures to reside there. In this way <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the queen</span> might have her wish.</span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">&nbsp;</span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">Towards the north, on Mount Cittakuta, there lived about ninety thousand wild geese headed by a <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">beautiful</span> <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">golden goose</span> called <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">King</span> Dhatarattha. He got to hear of this exquisite lake that was surrounded by flowers and trees and had lovely water lilies and lotuses floating on the surface. The <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">king</span> had named this lake after his wife Khema and had invited all the birds to come and live on it, promising that none of them would ever be harmed. Corn was scattered on a daily basis in order to attract the birds.</span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">&nbsp;</span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">So a couple of geese went up to their <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">King</span> and told him that they were quite tired of living up on the mountains and would like to see this wonderful lake where they had been promised food and protection.&nbsp;</span> <span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">The <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">king</span> agreed to their request and took the whole flock down south towards Benaras.</span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">&nbsp;<br />Meanwhile, at the lake</span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">King</span> had placed hunters all around in order to capture any <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">golden goose</span> that happened to pass by. So the next morning when the headhunter saw this flock of geese approaching he was very excited to see their golden leader. He immediately went about setting up a snare amongst the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">water lilies</span> and lotuses, as he knew that the leader would definitely be the first to alight.</span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">&nbsp;</span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">The whole flock came flying down in one mighty swoop and as expected it was the King's foot that touched the water first. He was ensnared and could not escape. Seeing this the other geese flew into a panic and honked in distress. But none had the courage to try to free their <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">king</span> and so flew back to Mount Cittacuta for safety. All except one. He was the chief captain, Sumukha.</span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">&nbsp;</span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">His <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">King</span> entreated him to fly to safety too, as he would surely be captured if he stayed by his side. But Sumukha replied that he would never desert his master in the face of danger and would either try to save him or die by his side.</span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">&nbsp;</span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">At this point the head huntsman approached and as Sumukha saw him he decided to appeal to his compassion. The hunter asked the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">King</span> how come he had not noticed the trap that was set. The <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">golden goose</span> replied that when one's time was up it was no use to struggle against what was fated and one must just accept it. The huntsman was very impressed with his grace and wisdom. He then turned to Sumukha and asked why he had not fled with the other birds even though he was free to do so. Sumukha answered that this was his King, best friend and master and that he could never desert him even at the cost of his own life.</span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">&nbsp;</span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">Hearing this the hunter realised that these were a couple of rare birds of great nobility. And were he to harm them, the gods would certainly punish him. Besides, he did not much care for his own King's reward and decided to do the right thing and set them free. He told Sumukha that as he was ready to die for his <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">King</span> he would set them both free to fly wherever they may.&nbsp;</span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">&nbsp;</span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">He then set loose the foot of the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">golden goose</span> and washed the wound clean. And when he made an attempt to fix the dislocated muscle \"lo behold\".. the foot was miraculously whole again as if it had never been hurt. Sumukha greatly blessed the hunter for his act of compassion and his <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">King</span> asked whether he had set the trap for himself or at someone else's command. The hunter answered that he had done it on the orders of his own <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">King</span>. He then went on to narrate to them the whole story about the queen's dream and her wish to see this rare <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">golden goose</span>.&nbsp;</span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">&nbsp;</span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">On hearing this, the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">golden goose</span> decided to go and meet the monarch, as he knew that the hunter would receive his reward. He had also heard about the wisdom and goodness of <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">King</span> Bahuputakka and thought that if he appeared out of his own free will, the monarch might allow him and his flock to come visit the lake. He therefore asked the hunter to take him to his <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">King</span>. The hunter advised him against it because he was worried that his monarch might imprison these two lovely creatures.</span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">&nbsp;</span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">But the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">golden goose</span> explained that just as they had been able to soften a hunter's heart it should not be too difficult to do the same to a great and noble&nbsp;<span class=\"IL_SPAN\">King</span>. He asked him to do his duty and leave the rest to him.&nbsp;</span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">&nbsp;</span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">So the hunter set out to go to the palace accompanied by these two noble, gorgeous creatures. Needless to say that the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">King</span> and Queen were absolutely delighted to see these two <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">beautiful</span> birds. The <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">King</span> set them on a golden perch and fed them himself, with honey, grain and sweetened milk. Then he spent the whole night discussing kingship and all its duties with this <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">King</span> of Geese. The <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">golden goose</span> did his best to offer good advice and encouragement in accordance with his wisdom.&nbsp;</span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">&nbsp;</span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">In the morning he thanked the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">King</span> and Queen for their hospitality and friendship and flew back to his flock accompanied by his faithful friend and chief captain Sumukha.</span></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/golden_goose1476423864972.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57936332784f768641802ba8","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"jataka tales"},{"text":"queen khema"},{"text":"benaras"},{"text":"golden goose"},{"text":"dhatarattha"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57fb6fc4e66f216b816f52ca","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.indiaparenting.com/stories/84_799/the-golden-goose.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-14T05:44:32.460Z","udate":"2016-10-20T12:40:05.618Z","expirydate":"2017-01-08T05:22:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-14T05:22:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"580070c004092b20a554d07d","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out8146.mp3","audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"jataka tales,queen khema,benaras,golden goose,dhatarattha","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Veteran beauty expert and founder-director of ALPS, Bharti Taneja shares some must-try tips to &lsquo;nail it&rsquo;. </strong><br /><br /><strong>Nails with a twist:</strong> These days, French nails in funky colors are seen making waves; besides the latest soak-off nail paints, last for no less than 20 days. So, if you are a victim of chipped nails, this one&rsquo;s worth a try. Also, if you are bored of the usual texture of your nail-dos &ndash; go wild with velvet nailpaints and nailpaints with foils &ndash; with a tendency to change its sheen. You can also choose specific colours for various occasions &ndash; like a pink for Valentines&rsquo; or shimmery gold shade for Diwali, or a ravishing red for your best friend&rsquo;s wedding. A perfect nail paint would make sure you rock-it in every avatar of you. <br /><br /><strong>Nail art:</strong> A nail- do where two or more nail paints are mixed makes way for a super nail art. This is often done along with few other nail accessories that are used to enhance the look of your fingers. There are a plenty of options to create a nail art &ndash; which can be done by yourself too. These can be accordingly customised depending upon a person&rsquo;s choice and mood.<br /><br /><strong>Nail extensions:</strong> Nail extensions are for those who complain of brittle, hence short nails. But if you yearn for longer looking nails, you can go for this trend. Also, there is no dearth of occasions, where we look charming from head-to-toe and suddenly find one of your nails broken. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />In such situations, only extensions can come to our rescue and can be good to go. For this special acrylic powder and liquids are used to paste the natural looking long nails on the original nails. These extensions are beautiful and last longer. They grow along your nails and stay for more than four months. And, while they grow, a little filling can be done at the nail bed so that they do not look artificial at all.<br /><br /><strong>Nail piercing:</strong> If you still find your nails to not complement your expensive studded costume, you still have a lot more to explore in the world of nails. Go for nail piercing by getting cute nail accessories like butterflies, bows, lips, stones, pearls and other studs pierced over your nail bed. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />The procedure which is absolutely painless and harmless is sure to compliment your special outfits. Also, if you would like to be on a little daring side always, you can opt for slightly long chains and accessories &ndash; which keep hanging beyond your nails to add extra zing to your personality. <br /><strong><br />3D nail art:</strong> Better known as a prominent sequel to &lsquo;nail art&rsquo;, this style is raging too amongst the youth, nowadays. Done using different coloured swaroskis, bows, pearls, stones and chains this is a shorter form of nail piercing &mdash; where these pretty frills attached on your nails lasts for a specified time period only. Moreover, a lot of asymmetrical studs are often used to garnish the overall look of our nails in 3D nail-art &ndash; while some nails are left blank to add a dash of unevenness to it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />You can go all wild while choosing the hues for nail-paints and accessories or also keep it a bit simple &ndash; if the occasion demands it to be so. But remember to make sure that you don&rsquo;t go overboard with all the bling together &ndash; so, if you chose your colour to be an electric blue &ndash; you may keep the accessories bright, but in contrast with the shade, that is, a bit softer one. Similarly, you can do vice versa, for creating your another 3D art. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Also, stay away from heavy finger/wrist accessories if you want your nails to do all the talking; going over the top with accessories would end up looking nothing &ndash; but dingy.<br /><br />While bound to enhance your personality, no matter how dull your dress shall be, these kind of nails demand extreme care in order to last longer. <br /><br />So, be it a simple nail paint applied onto your fingers or glistening pair of clipping attached over the nails, these art forms are to be dealt with utmost care. So, avoid washing clothes, utensils or any other actions that require your hands to be in water for hours. <br /><br />Keep the hands moisturised all day long and go for regular maintenance of your nails.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/nail1476423929276.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baabc5ecbc9256e95c1763","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"nails"},{"text":"nail-paints"},{"text":"bharti taneja"},{"text":"french nails"},{"text":"nail art"},{"text":"nail extensions"},{"text":"nail piercing"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/574460/its-time-go-nailbiting-finish.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-14T05:45:43.278Z","udate":"2016-10-14T06:46:47.152Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-14T05:44:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"5800710704092b20a554d08c","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6731.mp3","tagsForSearch":"nails,nail-paints,bharti taneja,french nails,nail art,nail extensions,nail piercing","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Brows have often been considered a symbol of youth and beauty. If you&rsquo;re fed up of filling in your brows with pencils and creams, there&rsquo;s a solution at hand. Microblading uses ink to mimic natural hairs providing fuller brows.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Semi-permanent solution</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Microblading is an advanced method of non-surgical creation of the eyebrow. It works in the same way as a traditional tattoo except that individual hairs of the eyebrow can be seen. We have started offering this service in the last three months with a very good response,&rdquo; says Dr Mohan Thomas, Senior Cosmetic Surgeon, Cosmetic Surgery Institute and Breach Candy Hospital. It is recommended for women who have no eyebrows at all as this method will give them a natural looking brow, men and women who want their eyebrows to look more dense and fuller and those who would like to change the way their eyebrows look every year, as this is a semi-permanent technique.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gives a natural effect</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr Apratim Goel, dermatologist and laser surgeon, Cutis skin studio, explains the procedure. &ldquo;After a thorough consult with your aesthetician, local anesthetic cream is applied to numb the area and make the procedure virtually pain- free. The area to be worked upon is meticulously outlined, followed by the use of a manual pen-like device, comprising 7+ micro-needles to etch strokes and deposit the pigments. Approximately 35 strokes are carved on each side, and if more is required, it is covered during the touch up session, generally four weeks later. Whereas traditional tattooing uses needles on a rotary/coil machine to push ink seven layers deep into the skin, microblading uses a manual blade and only targets three layers of skin. It creates subtle, natural-looking brows by mimicking the strokes of eyebrow hairs.&rdquo;\\</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Makes a difference</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Anyone who wants to emphasise their brows will love this procedure and the time saved of not having to pencil them in, says Dr Geeta Oberoi, dermatologist and founder, Skin and You clinic. &ldquo;Once the procedure is complete, for the initial few days you are advised not to go under water or for sauna baths as there are chances of tattoo fading. It is best to avoid such activities. Choose between a soft texture look or hair simulation. If you have no brow hair or sparse brows due to over-plucking, then the difference balanced brows can make is amazing.&rdquo;</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/micro1476425312423.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57bab874ecbc9256e95c1835","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"microblading"},{"text":"subtle"},{"text":"natural looking hair"},{"text":"beauty"},{"text":"tattoo"},{"text":"dr mohan thomas"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-microblading-it-s-all-about-the-brow-2263319","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-14T06:08:46.947Z","udate":"2016-10-14T06:47:11.337Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-14T06:08:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"5800766e46c144208b5f3ac8","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out5197.mp3","tagsForSearch":"microblading,subtle,natural looking hair,beauty,tattoo,dr mohan thomas","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Ravana, predictably, falls head on into this trap.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dashaanan, the one with ten heads, a multi-faceted character - the progeny of Brahma, the greatest of Shiva bhakts credited for the tandav, a virtuoso veena player and a master astrologer - is reduced to Ravana, the evil ruler of Lanka who kidnapped Sita. &ldquo;Valmiki and Ved Vyas did not mean for their characters to be interpreted in black and white. They were master storytellers, who brought out many more shades of grey than Erika Mitchell does, in each of their characters,&rdquo; says Dr Gopalakrishnan, a sixth-generation Ayurveda practitioner at Kattanam in Aleppey, Kerala. Ravana, he adds, had mastered the four vedas, the six shastras and had knowledge of the 64 arts, including Ayurveda and sutra-krida - the art of playing with thread, or simply embroidery.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Maker of cures Dr Bhattacharya discovered the many talents of Ravana from friends in south India, upon studying Ayurveda and from her guru, Professor Chandra Bhushan Jha. &ldquo;Sri Lanka is a great place for biodiversity. Ravana, known as the man who knows the forest, was a glutton for knowledge,&rdquo; says Dr Bhattacharya, who divides her time as a clinical assistant professor at Weill Cornell Medical College, New York and as a PhD candidate at the Banaras Hindu University (BHU). &ldquo;He knew how to make medicines and lived for thousands and thousands of years.&rdquo; BHU's Prof Jha echoes that Ravana was an expert at making Ayurvedic medicines, including from metals such as mercury - which can otherwise be fatal. &ldquo;In his treatise, Ravana has mentioned each and every material, not just aromatic plants or arsenic, but the full spectrum of materials for their therapeutic purpose,&rdquo; says the professor.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Among Ayurvedic texts, the Rakshasa Raja is credited with the composition of books on Arka - medicines prepared by the technique of distillation - as well as Nadi Pariksha (the art of pulse diagnosis). Ravana's book on the latter is much more accurate and followed than Kanada Muni's Nadi pariksha,&rdquo; adds Dr Gopalakrishnan, who associates with Ayurveda hospital Santhigiri's Research Foundation. &ldquo;More than Ayurveda, it is the Siddha system of medicine that holds Ravana in high esteem. Many marma masters speak of him reverentially as a master of the system.&rdquo; Doctoral legacy In Dr Bhattacharya's opinion, Ravana was a great clinician. He not only made medicine, but was a scholar of poison, albeit one who could also antidote the poison - a rare trait indeed. &ldquo;He did practise Ayurveda, but there were thousands of other Ayurveda practitioners. Ravana was outstanding because he lived for so long... although he used his thirst for knowledge in a selfish manner,&rdquo; says Dr Bhattacharya.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr Gopalakrishnan says, &ldquo;It is said that the ideal physician would be an optimum combination of many qualities. Many of these were found in Ravana. He could have been one of the brightest stars in the firmament of Ayurveda, but he was too preoccupied writing veena sonatas and spiriting away Sita. The best physician would be one who has overcome greed and ego and other such affections of the mind. Ravana, sadly, had not.&rdquo;</p>\n</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/Ravana1476425617356.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57bab874ecbc9256e95c1835","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"ravana"},{"text":"dussehra"},{"text":"ayurveda"},{"text":"dr bhattacharya"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57fb6fc4e66f216b816f52ca","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.dnaindia.com/delhi/report-how-urdu-calligraphy-is-being-revived-in-tattoo-studios-of-south-delhi-2263351","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-14T06:13:44.801Z","udate":"2016-10-14T07:12:17.897Z","expirydate":"2017-02-01T06:07:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-14T06:07:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"5800779824f5e1084b200536","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out4041.mp3","tagsForSearch":"ravana,dussehra,ayurveda,dr bhattacharya","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Oxygen facials work by infusing this vital element into the skin along with other essentials vitamins, giving a plumper, more youthful appearance. Dr Jaishree Sharad, dermatologist and CEO, Skinfiniti Aesthetic Skin &amp; Laser Clinic explains, &ldquo;All our body cells need oxygen to sustain life and vitality of function.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Oxygen therapy is based on this principle. Here the skin is refreshed with an oxygen jet, this delivers concentrated oxygen with pressure on the skin, the penetration is hence enhanced. This removes metabolic products more efficiently including the dead cells from the surface of the skin and hence the skin seems more fresh.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It&rsquo;s like spraying the skin with a magic elixir of life.&rdquo; Next up a vitamin serum is applied on the face and a mesoporation device is used. &ldquo;This device helps open channels in the skin through which the absorption of vitamins and hyaluronic acid solutions would be enhanced. The end result is a rejuvenated and smooth look with reduced fine lines and open pores,&rdquo; adds Dr Jaishree. One of the main reasons for the popularity of this facial is that it helps to conceal the imperfections albeit temporarily, lending a more radiant finish. This procedure can be done every 15 days. It is also safe for all skin types as it is a non-invasive treatment.

With the passage of time, there have been numerous technological advancements in the field of medical science. However, the incidence of cardiovascular diseases have been on the rise in recent years. We asked cardiology experts what worries them the most regarding people&rsquo;s health and what is the need of the hour? Read on to know more...</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Dr Shahid Merchant, Senior Consultant Cardiologist, Lilavati Hospital</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">- What worries me the most as a cardiologist today, is the high incidence of heart attacks among young Indians between the age group of 25 to 40 years. They have young families to take care of, just getting settled in their jobs and this sudden blow of heart disease turns their lives upside down.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">- The reasons are stressful lifestyle, smoking, irregular eating time and wrong foods, long hours of work, late nights and lack of sleep. To add to this, they have no time for exercise, leading to bigger waistlines and obesity. Also, we have a metabolic tendency for diabetes and low HDL.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What is the need of the hour?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">- We need tests and preventive cardiovascular programs to detect vulnerable plaques to prevent risks of acute heart attacks.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">- Prevention is still the key with healthy lifestyle changes like exercise, meditation and yoga, low fat and low refined sugar diet, maintaining body weight and quitting smoking or chewing tobacco. Knowing your numbers and maintaining them is crucial to prevention of heart disease. Blood pressure should be 120/80, total cholesterol &lt; 150, fasting blood sugar &lt; 100, post meal blood sugar &lt; 140. Yearly preventive cardiac checkup, control of risk factors like diabetes, hypertension and primary prophylaxis with aspirin, statins and antioxidants is the key.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Dr Anuj Bhasin, Interventional Cardiologist, SRV hospital</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">- What worries him the most about about people today, in terms of cardiovascular health, despite technological advancements is the risk of sudden heart attack in view of stress and poor lifestyle (junk food, smoking, alcohol). There&rsquo;s more prevalence of disease in young patients. There&rsquo;s an alarming rise as compared to previous figures, now more than 25 per cent patients are less than 40 years of age.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What is the need of the hour?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">- Dr Bhasin suggests lowering stress by doing yoga and getting adequate sleep. He also suggests consuming healthy food, avoiding smoking and alcohol, doing moderate intensity exercise five days a week.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">- Individuals with strong family history of heart diseases, hypertension and diabetes should get regular health check-ups like treadmill test and lipid profile.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">- Do not ignore symptoms of chest pain and breathlessness when walking.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Dr Amit Sharma, Interventional Cardiologist, Holy Spirit Hospital</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">- While we have made immense strides in the treatment of heart diseases, the preventive aspect of heart disease is sadly neglected. Eating habits and other lifestyle factors play a major role in determining the risk factor of heart diseases. Infections, excessive stress, lack of proper exercise and diet are far more damaging to the heart.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What is the need of the hour?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">- Stress and fast-paced life is taking a toll on Mumbai&rsquo;s young population. We must learn to adapt to daily stress and ditch poor lifestyle habits, which are adding to the risk of heart diseases. Most cardiac patients have suffered stress. That also starts from a young age. For example, during school days, kids face peer pressure and that continues till their professional life. Apart from that kids are in a never ending race. Somebody wants to be IAS, IITian, engineer, and to achieve that they are constantly battling with stress.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Dr Vijaya Baskar, Lead of Rehabilitation, Nightingales Home Health Specialist</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">- In his practice, he&rsquo;s observed that work stress has an extremely bad effect on health because people are being pushed to their limits. They consume numerous cups of coffee, smoking and alcohol to beat stress. But these very things are making matters worse for them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">- Today, we see people even in their late 20s who suffer cardiac attacks, most of them are males.

That could be because younger women are now getting earlier and better treatment for breast cancer, Richardson said in a telephone interview. \"Younger black women tend to have more aggressive cancer and if you don't get the therapy right, it is difficult to make up the difference later,\" Richardson said. \"We're hopeful the lack of difference in death rates between black and white women under 50 will start to be seen in older women.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A healthy diet, exercise and maintaining a normal weight are among factors that can help prevent breast cancer, Richardson said.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/US1476427257767.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57bab874ecbc9256e95c1835","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"breast cancer"},{"text":"lung cancer"},{"text":"women"},{"text":"us centers for disease control and prevention"},{"text":"healthy diet"},{"text":"exercise"},{"text":"normal weight"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.dnaindia.com/health/report-us-breast-cancer-deaths-drop-rate-among-white-women-falls-most-2263964","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-14T06:41:12.309Z","udate":"2016-10-14T06:51:36.571Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-14T06:40:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"58007e08b011453674500710","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out2778.mp3","tagsForSearch":"breast cancer,lung cancer,women,us centers for disease control and prevention,healthy diet,exercise,normal weight","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

However, the number of TB deaths and the TB incidence rate continue to fall globally and in India,\" WHO said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It said that in 2015, there were an estimated 10.4 million new (incident) TB cases worldwide, of which 5.9 million (56%) were among men, 3.5 million (34%) among women and 1.0 million (10%) among children while people living with HIV accounted for 1.2 million (11%) of all new TB cases. \"Six countries accounted for 60% of the new cases - India, Indonesia, China, Nigeria, Pakistan and South Africa.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Global progress depends on major advances in TB prevention and care in these countries,\" the global health body said in its report.

Although the number of TB deaths fell by 22% between 2000 and 2015, TB remained one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide in 2015,\" it said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">WHO said that in 2015, 6.1 million new TB cases were notified to national authorities and reported to WHO while notified TB cases increased from 2013 2015, mostly due to a 34% increase in notifications in India. \"However, globally there was a 4. 3 million gap between incident and notified cases, with India, Indonesia and Nigeria accounting for almost half of this gap. The crisis of MDR-TB detection and treatment continues.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"In 2015, of the estimated 580000 people newly eligible for MDR-TB treatment, only 125000 (20%) were enrolled. Five countries accounted for more than 60% of the gap - India, China, the Russian Federation, Indonesia and Nigeria,\" it said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">WHO said that the upward revisions to estimates of the burden of TB disease in India for the period 2000 2015 follow accumulating evidence that previous estimates were \"too low\".</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"This evidence includes household surveys, a state-wide TB prevalence survey, studies of anti-TB drug sales in the private sector, notification data and new analysis of mortality data. \"Since India accounts for more than one quarter of the world's TB cases and deaths, these revisions have had a major impact on global estimates. Estimates for India are considered interim, pending a national TB prevalence survey scheduled for 2017/2018,\" WHO said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It said that in the African Region where the burden of HIV-associated TB is highest, 81% of notified TB patients had a documented HIV test result. \"The proportion of known HIV-positive TB patients on ART was above 90% in India, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia and Swaziland,\" it said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giving out details about India, WHO said mortality (HIV+TB only) was 37 per thousand while incidence (HIV+TB only) was 113 per thousand. Estimated TB incidence in India in 2015 in the age group of 0-14 years for both males and females was 255 per thousand.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Commenting on the report and the disease in the South East Asian Region which also includes India, WHO Regional Director (SEARO) Poonam Khetrapal Singh said TB remains a serious problem across the region and requires the fullest attention and strongest commitment of governments. \"As outlined in WHO's new global report on TB, a number of countries in the region are among the world's highest TB burden countries, while revised estimates based on increased case-reporting and enhanced surveillance show that the TB caseload is higher than previously projected. TB is the single largest cause of death of any infectious disease in the region, and remains responsible for incalculable suffering, premature mortality, impoverishment and foregone development,\" she said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She said though countries have been making efforts to end TB and the number of TB deaths and its incidence rate continues to fall, at the current trend the region would not be able to achieve the SDG targets. \"A newer and bolder approach is needed to bend the curve faster and sharper to achieve the global targets. This means intensifying measures to ensure early diagnosis and treatment, such as active case-finding and enhancing access to cutting-edge diagnostic tools. Adopting newer approaches of case diagnosis, community based treatment and treatment of latent infection. It means integrating TB programmes with existing health systems, thereby amplifying the effect these interventions have,\" she said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Singh also said that funds must be allocated accordingly, while political commitment must be fortified and both must occur at national and international levels.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/TB1476427435318.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57bab874ecbc9256e95c1835","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"tuberculosis"},{"text":"who"},{"text":"hiv"},{"text":"epidemic"},{"text":"disease"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.dnaindia.com/health/report-tb-epidemic-in-india-larger-than-what-was-previously-2263981","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-14T06:44:09.684Z","udate":"2016-10-14T06:52:05.141Z","expirydate":"2016-12-31T06:44:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"58007eb90eac6818dc69e61f","publishedOn":"2016-10-14T06:44:00.000Z","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6402.mp3","tagsForSearch":"tuberculosis,who,hiv,epidemic,disease","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Thus began my life as a self-taught understudy of an artist, who has now been given the Nobel Prize in Literature&nbsp;on Thursday for &ldquo;having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition,&rdquo; in the words of the Swedish Academy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dylan is the first major songwriter to have won the award for Literature since it was instituted in 1901. He shot into the commercial music scene, by playing at bars and pubs in the Greenwich Village in New York as a wiry 20-year-old.&nbsp;The choice of the award for Dylan is unconventional as it has not been given for a body of literary work -- novels, plays, poems or short stories.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the early 1960s, Dylan became famous for protest songs such as &ldquo;Blowin in the wind&rdquo;, &lsquo;The times, they are changin&rsquo; and the anti-war piece &ldquo;Masters of war&rdquo;. But he would soon abandon his &lsquo;roots&rsquo;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, he played with an electric band, shocking his audience and, in a later show, prompting cries of &lsquo;Judas&rsquo;. In the same year, Dylan would also perform &ldquo;Just like a rolling stone&rdquo; which redefined rock music.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dylan&rsquo;s songs became increasingly ambiguous and his voice gravelly and harsh. Songs like &ldquo;Mr Tambourine man&rdquo; seemed to originate from the drug trips of the singer. Dylan also wrote quite a few songs on love gone wrong like &ldquo;Tangled up in blue&rdquo; and &ldquo;Simple twist of fate&rdquo;. In fact, he is an acknowledged master of this sub-genre.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Right from the beginning, his songs were played by other bands -- The Byrds, Joan Baez, Peter, Paul and Mary, The Animals, Jeff Buckley, and Jerry Garcia Band. Some of these songs were chartbusters, often pipping Dylan himself to the post. The musician&rsquo;s life, times and work were put under the microscope. Several biographies were also published.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dylan is the first American to have been given the award since Toni Morrison in 1993.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Long before he got the Grammys, Oscar, Golden Globe, Pulitzer and the US Presidential Medal For Freedom, Dylan was an immensely popular artist, having sold over 100 million albums. Albums like &ldquo;Blonde on blonde&rdquo; and &ldquo;Highway 61 revisited&rdquo; made in the 1960s have cemented his position among the rock greats.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dylan has also bought out his memoirs &ldquo;Chronicles: Vol 1&rdquo;, which revealed in the musician&rsquo;s own words, his early life in New York and his struggle to make it in the big bad world of rock music. Dylan is also a scriptwriter, painter and sculptor. He has appeared in many films including &ldquo;Renaldo and Clara&rdquo;, which he directed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While on the &ldquo;Never Ending Tour&rdquo;, which began in 1988, Dylan&rsquo;s rendition of his songs changed on each show. He teased out different meaning every time, the drawl never quite the same at any point.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">French authors like Arthur Rimbaud have been a big influence on Dylan. He was also part of the movement ignited by Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. His words were pictorial, refrains incisive and rhythms electrifying.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dylan was also a great storyteller. &ldquo;Hurricane&rdquo; and &ldquo;The lonesome death of Hattie Carroll&rdquo; are exemplary pieces in which Dylan uses his extraordinary skills to tell the real stories of people on the wrong end of the law.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On Thursday, after announcing the prize, Sara Danius, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, said the decision was not a difficult one and hoped that the news would be received with joy. She compared Dylan with Homer and Sappho.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dylan was born Robert Zimmerman in 1941 in Duluth, Minnesota, USA, and received his first guitar at age 14. He played in school bands and in college assumed the name Bob Dylan after poet Dylan Thomas.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dylan has had an on-again, off-again relationship with religion. Though he was born a Jew, he would became a &lsquo;born again&rsquo; Christian in the late 1970s. However, Dylan has denied his involvement with religion at any major level.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dylan was married twice and had five children. The birth of one of his children, born to backup singer Carolyn Dennis, whom he married, was kept a secret until the publication of his biography, &ldquo;Down the Highway&rdquo;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most of the albums in the Dylan canon were recorded in single takes. Not much overdubbing was ever done. He also kept rewriting his songs in the studio and often confounded accompanying musicians by expecting them to play along. Even the landmark album of the 1970s, &ldquo;Blood on the tracks&rdquo; was produced in this fashion, with guitarists and drummers accompanying him with no clue as to what the next note might be.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In recent years, Dylan has been courted by everybody. In 2009, he appeared in a Pepsi ad and went on to collect several Grammys. His image is becoming commercialised by the day, with the iTunes store bringing out an entire collection of Dylan songs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It may not be incorrect to say that with the Nobel, Dylan has gone on to cap his career with the highest of honours. This will also, hopefully, turn the attention of a new generation of rock audience to his songs.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/Bob_Dylan1476429737207.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57933a4336a438977861cf44","publisherSectionName":"","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"bob dylan"},{"text":"nobel"},{"text":"horner"},{"text":"sappho"},{"text":"literature"},{"text":"songwriter"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57fb6fc4e66f216b816f52ca","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/falling-love-bob-dylan-fan-experience-his-music-51343","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-14T07:22:25.277Z","udate":"2016-12-17T10:49:05.140Z","expirydate":"2017-01-01T07:18:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-14T07:18:00.000Z","publiseherSectionId":"","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"580087b1bebf7f1ffd47e1e5","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out7155.mp3","audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"bob dylan,nobel,horner,sappho,literature,songwriter","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
{"_id":"580088bd1437c60246f57f91","title":"Why Bob Dylan deserves his Nobel prize in literature","subtitle":"Dylan's stature as the poet of rock and roll has never really been much in doubt.","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb900dea63af2cd0d814cf","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/live/2016/oct/13/nobel-prize-in-literature-2016-liveblog?page=with:block-57ff87ebe4b0160123895641#liveblog-navigation\">surprise</a> of many, Bob Dylan has become the first singer-songwriter to win the Nobel prize in literature.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the news broke, I was in the middle of teaching James Joyce to some undergraduates &ndash; an author who did not win the Nobel, but is often considered a pinnacle of high literature. Many wouldn&rsquo;t look to compare these two artists, not least <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonpinter/status/786525603495280640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">those already protesting</a> that Dylan&rsquo;s win cheapens the award. But in many ways, they&rsquo;re alike. I&rsquo;m thrilled. Dylan&rsquo;s win has been a slow train coming.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Meanwhile, Dylan will have been gearing up for another gig &ndash; much as he has been doing for more than half a century. On his Nobel-winning night he&rsquo;s set to play Las Vegas, so it&rsquo;s good to hear that he&rsquo;s won a prize based on the reasonable judgement of a committee of high-minded enlightened experts and not just on the throw of the dice.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In terms of stamina alone, he&rsquo;s a worthy winner but &ndash; more than that &ndash; it is the quality and the generosity of the achievement that it&rsquo;s a pleasure to recognise. It&rsquo;s great for his millions of fans around the world, old and young, great for the prize and great for the idea that popular music and serious literature aren&rsquo;t necessarily so different after all.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"caption\">Members of the media react to the news that Bob Dylan won the 2016 Nobel prize in literature.</span> <span class=\"attribution\"><span class=\"source\">Jonas Ekstromer/EPA</span></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The world of Dylan&rsquo;s most distinctive lyrics is probably more Las Vegas than it is Stockholm &ndash; his songs are more often populated with gamblers than writers and academics. But his stature as the poet of rock and roll has never really been much in doubt. The significant presence of literary culture in what Variety magazine once mocked as the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=i25JXXi1E4MC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=%E2%80%9Cdeliberately+iggerunt%E2%80%9D+dylan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AzCc1pp5-P&amp;sig=Yww5xcYd8us9fGSngWi_lmS1jkA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_pMq5jdjPAhUrJsAKHUy1A0IQ6AEIIzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9Cdeliberately%20iggerunt%E2%80%9D%20dylan&amp;f=false\">deliberately iggerunt</a>&rdquo; vernacular language of his songs has increasingly been revealed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The seriousness of the literary as well as musical achievement has gradually gained more and more respect and leading academic critics, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/sep/14/music\">Christopher Ricks</a>, have been keen to recognise and to try to account for it. His autobiographical <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/16/highereducation.biography\">Chronicles</a> are packed with references to and anecdotes about writers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">References and anecdotes are also something that filled Joyce&rsquo;s pages. Curiously, Goddard Lieberson, president of Columbia Records at the time Dylan was beginning his recording career, gave him a first-edition copy of Joyce&rsquo;s masterwork Ulysses. Dylan professed that &ldquo;he couldn&rsquo;t make hide nor hair of it&rdquo;. He wanted the poet Archibald MacLeish to explain it to him but didn&rsquo;t get around to asking in the end.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Readers of Joyce as well as Dylan might recognise that as just the kind of thing that happens to Joyce&rsquo;s hero Leopold Bloom. Ulysses is full of snatches of songs and music &ndash; and if it had been written a few years later Bob Dylan would have been in there for sure.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What a lucky man to own a first edition of such a famous text &ndash; now one of the most prized and valuable of all collectible rare and vintage books (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jun/04/ulysses-sells-record-price\">one sold in 2009 for &pound;275,000</a>) as well as one that is most valued by serious literary critics and readers all over the world. Not a bad insurance policy just in case the recording career didn&rsquo;t take off.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But of course it did take off &ndash; and how. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine a more prominent living figure in American culture &ndash; perhaps even world culture &ndash; than Bob Dylan, or one whose work combines a more richly poetic and surreal artistry in its vision of the contemporary world, a more iconoclastic sense of social justice, more notes of personal intimacy or such a dry and acute sense of humour. There is nobody better capable of provoking his huge and amazingly loyal audience with new challenges, at the same time as endearing himself to them all the more.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I hope the buskers and street singers in the subways and on the street corners around the world dust off their favourite Dylan standards and sing them out loud. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine that there&rsquo;s anyone with or without a guitar or harmonica who hasn&rsquo;t tried to strum some Dylan chords or mimic that unmistakeable voice at some point in their lives &ndash; just to try to answer that great Dylan anthem question: &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxLMr784l0Q\">How does it feel?</a>&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">How does it feel for Dylan to win the Nobel? Let&rsquo;s hope he tells us in the acceptance speech &ndash; or in song.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/67017/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/Bob_Dylan1476430005452.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57933a4336a438977861cf44","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"dylan"},{"text":"first"},{"text":"singer-writer"},{"text":"nobel"},{"text":"literature"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57fb6fc4e66f216b816f52ca","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/why-bob-dylan-deserves-his-nobel-prize-literature-51331","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-14T07:26:53.984Z","udate":"2016-12-17T10:49:35.195Z","expirydate":"2017-01-07T07:23:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-14T07:23:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"580088bd1437c60246f57f93","publishedBy":"581885fc3072f0321dfd55cc","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out2424.mp3","audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"dylan,first,singer-writer,nobel,literature","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, is responsible for carrying the sugar or glucose, from the bloodstream to the individual cells. When the pancreas fails to produce insulin, glucose builds up in your bloodstream and enters your urine. <strong>Homeopathy focuses on the overall health of the individual. Homeopathic medicines for diabetes include:</strong><br />1. <strong>Abroma Augusta: </strong>This homeopathic medicine is best for diabetics who have weak muscles, increased appetites and frequent urination.<br />2. <strong>Phosphorus: </strong>If symptoms include weak vision, Phosphorus is the best remedy for it.<br />3. <strong>Syzygium Jambolanum: </strong>This is one of the best homeopathic remedies for diabetes mellitus. It acts efficiently and promptly in lowering sugar levels.<br />4. <strong>Phosphoric acid: </strong>If you feel exhausted or weak all the time, either physically or mentally, then Phosphoric acid is beneficial. Weak memory, forgetfulness and numb feet are also treated with Phosphoric acid.<br />5. <strong>Gymnema Sylvestre: </strong>Sometimes, diabetics drastically lose weight and have low energy levels. Gymnema Sylvestre is an excellent remedy for such symptoms.<br /><br /><strong>Sometimes one or more homeopathic medicines may be combined to treat symptoms. Some common combinations include:</strong><br />1. Lachesis, Arnica, Belladonna and Phosphorus are combined in a treatment to treat retinopathy, which is damage to the eyes caused by diabetes.<br />2. Serum Anguillae, Arsenic Album and Lycopodium are used together to treat kidney damage (nephropathy) in diabetics.<br />3. Helonias, Sulphur and Phosphoric acid are taken to deal with neuropathy or nerve problems such as numbness in feet and hands.<br />4. Syzygium Jambolanum is combined with Secale Cornutum to treat skin ulcers, which is a common problem among diabetics.<br />5.

{"_id":"58009434bebf7f1ffd47e25b","title":"Update narrow focus of Nobel Prizes","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fde34a4ac2d218b1a5c","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Science's reach has relentlessly expanded. However, the Nobel Foundation has largely ignored that evolution.<a name=\"top\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>In the mid-1960s, Robert Paine, a scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle, discovered a hidden organising principle in the coastal ecosystem he was studying. </strong><br /><br />When a certain species of starfish was present, a panoply of algae, limpets, barnacles, anemones and mussels lived in delicate, dynamic balance. But when he removed the starfish and tossed them into the ocean, that balance collapsed and one kind of mussel took over. <br /><br />Dr Paine coined a term to describe the starfish&rsquo;s outsize influence: keystone species. Keystone species have since been identified in forests, in grasslands, in the ocean and even in the human gut. The concept has become one of ecology&rsquo;s guiding theoretical principles, and it has had a profound impact, inspiring, among other things, the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone, where they help control elk that can otherwise overgraze aspen and willow trees. <br /><br />If Dr Paine, who passed away in June, had been a physicist, chemist or cell biologist, such a fundamental, broadly applicable and hugely influential paradigm would probably have put him in contention for a Nobel Prize. But Paine was an ecologist, so he had no shot at the prestige, power and wealth that the Nobels bestow. The same can be said for the world&rsquo;s top geologists, oceanographers, meteorologists, climatologists, crop scientists, botanists, entomologists and practitioners of many other fields. <br /><br />Science&rsquo;s reach has relentlessly expanded to include ever more facets of our world, and it has become increasingly important to our lives. But the world&rsquo;s most important scientific honour society has largely ignored that evolution. As a result, the Nobel Prizes, being announced this week, are reserved for an ever-shrinking fraction of the scientific community and are receding from the interests of society at large. It&rsquo;s high time for an update. <br /><br />The Nobel Prizes were the brainchild of Alfred B Nobel, an idiosyncratic Swedish industrialist best known for inventing dynamite. Having no immediate heirs, he declared that the bulk of his fortune would be used to annually reward the persons &ldquo;who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind&rdquo; in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace. <br /><br />When Nobel wrote his will in 1895, the three scientific fields he named were indeed generating the most spectacular discoveries, and Nobel Prizes soon recognised world-changing advances: X-rays, radioactivity, artificial fertiliser, vitamins, nuclear fission and many more. <br /><br />But the world of science has broadened and matured spectacularly since the late 1800s. The British Ecological Society, the world&rsquo;s oldest ecology organisation, was founded in 1913. Geology received a huge boost in 1915, when Alfred Wegener proposed continental drift, which led to a unified explanation for phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanoes and mountain formation. The first computerised weather model was produced only in the 1950s, and climate science has grown exponentially since the danger of global warming was first recognised some 60 years ago. <br /><br /><strong>Absence of recognition</strong><br /><br />Discoveries in those fields are increasingly critical for addressing today&rsquo;s most pressing problems, from conservation of endangered species to earthquake and hurricane prediction. And yet the Nobel Foundation has taken no meaningful steps to recognise them. Forests and oceans are essential to making the planet hospitable, yet there is no scientific Nobel that a forest or ocean researcher could remotely dream of winning. Nor is there a Nobel for science education or outreach. <br /><br />An agronomist, Norman Borlaug, did win a Nobel in 1970 for wheat breeding research that arguably saved more lives than any physics, chemistry or biology prizewinning discovery ever. So did the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, along with Al Gore, in 2007. But they all won the Nobel Peace Prize, not any of the science prizes. <br /><br />In 2009, 10 prominent scientists and engineers, including a Nobel laureate, wrote an open letter asking the foundation to recognise more areas of science. They pointed out that a similar evolution was recognised with the 1968 establishment of a Nobel calibre prize in economics, defusing the counterargument that the foundation was constrained by Nobel&rsquo;s will. The Nobel Foundation responded, in essence, by saying the committees that made the awards &ldquo;have been reasonably successful up till now in tracing major developments of modern civilisation.&rdquo; <br /><br />The Nobels&rsquo; narrow focus creates a two-tiered scientific universe, wherein only select fields have access to a uniquely powerful publicity mechanism. Nobel laureates receive media exposure and increases in professional status and opportunities that are all but unequaled in science. They frequently meet with high-level policy makers, and their prizes are leveraged for prestige and resources by their institutions and countries. <br /><br />I&rsquo;m not saying we shouldn&rsquo;t celebrate those who are honoured by the Nobel committees. Great science, like a great symphony or painting, can inspire. Sometimes the research that is rewarded leads to discoveries that make our lives better. <br /><br />It&rsquo;s at least as wonderful to tackle environmental problems, predict natural disasters, demystify how species interact. The Nobel organisation should take a bold leap into the present and shine its bright light more widely &mdash; and unshackle itself from a 19th-century vision of what makes good science. </p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/nobel1476432941516.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baabc5ecbc9256e95c1763","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"science"},{"text":"nobel prize"},{"text":"robert paine"},{"text":"alfred nobel"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57fb6fc4e66f216b816f52ca","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/574716/update-narrow-focus-nobel-prizes.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-14T08:15:48.538Z","udate":"2016-10-14T09:16:03.190Z","expirydate":"2017-01-01T08:10:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-14T09:13:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"58009434bebf7f1ffd47e25d","id":"58009434bebf7f1ffd47e25b","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"tagsForSearch":"science,nobel prize,robert paine,alfred nobel","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

In fact, baking soda can help you look your best from head to toe.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate, a natural substance that is crystalline but often appears as a fine powder. This alkaline substance has&nbsp;<strong>antibacterial, antifungal, antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties</strong>. It is also a powerful medical tool effective at combating everything from colds to oral problems to skin issues.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Baking soda is effective when used for short periods.</strong>&nbsp;However, excessive use can damage your skin and hair. Also, you should do a patch test to determine whether your skin is sensitive to it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Fights Acne and Pimples</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To get rid of acne or pimples, you do not need harsh chemicals. Baking soda will do the work easily. The antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties of this kitchen staple helps treat the cause as well as reduce the symptoms of acne and other breakouts.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition, it helps balance the skin&rsquo;s pH, which helps&nbsp;reduce the occurrence of skin breakouts.</p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Mix 1 teaspoon of baking soda with a little water to make a paste.</li>\n<li>Apply it on the affected skin for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>\n<li>Rinse it off with cold water.</li>\n<li>Repeat once daily for 2 or 3 days, then reduce the frequency to&nbsp;1 or 2&nbsp;times a week.</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Brightens Yellow Teeth</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Baking soda is excellent for making your pearly whites shine. It works as a mild abrasive to remove yellow stains from your teeth. In addition, it helps remove plaque by neutralizing acids produced by the bacteria.</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>You can simply put a little&nbsp;baking soda on your toothbrush along with your regular toothpaste. Brush your teeth as usual for 2 minutes. Do it once daily for a few days.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, prepare a homemade teeth whitener with 4 tablespoons of turmeric root powder, 2 teaspoons of baking soda and 3 tablespoons of extra-virgin coconut oil. Mix all the ingredients thoroughly. Use a small amount of this paste to brush your teeth once daily for a few days.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Relieves Sunburn and Sunburn Blisters</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">During the summer, keep a box of baking soda handy. Due to its alkaline nature, baking soda has a soothing affect on sunburned skin, which helps relieve the itching and burning sensations. It also has mild antiseptic and drying properties that help&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.top10homeremedies.com/how-to/how-to-get-rid-of-sunburn-blisters.html\">dry out sunburn blisters</a>&nbsp;quickly.</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Mix 1 to 2 tablespoons of baking soda in a cup of cold water. Soak a clean washcloth in this solution, wring out the excess water and apply it as a cool compress on the affected area for 5 to 10 minutes. Repeat 2 or 3 times a day until you get relief.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, add &frac12; cup of baking soda to a bathtub filled with water. Stir well and soak yourself in this water for 10 to 15 minutes. After getting out of the bath, pat dry or allow your body to air dry. Do this once daily for a few days.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Improves Skin Complexion</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Uneven skin tone is a major problem for many. If you want a brighter and even skin tone, baking soda is an easy and inexpensive solution.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is a good exfoliating agent that helps remove dead cells. In addition, it balances pH level of the skin, which is very important to maintain even and clear skin.</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Mix 1 to 2 teaspoons of baking soda with enough filtered water or rose water to make a paste. Apply the paste on your face. Allow it to sit for 1 minute, then gently rub it off using only the tips of your fingers. Finally, wash with lukewarm water and pat dry to reveal brighter skin. Follow this remedy 1 or 2 times a week only. Make sure to moisturize your skin after using baking soda.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, mix 1 tablespoon each of baking soda and fresh lemon juice along with 4 or 5 drops of extra-virgin olive oil. Apply this paste on your face. Leave it on for 5 minutes, then rinse it off with cold water. Repeat 2 or 3 times a week.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Treats Stained or Yellow Nails</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Stained nails can be unsightly, but&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.top10homeremedies.com/how-to/get-rid-yellow-nails.html\">baking soda can whiten your nails</a>&nbsp;so you do not have to hide them in your pockets or gloves. Its bleaching and exfoliating properties help remove stains.</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Put &frac12; cup of water, 1 teaspoon of 3% hydrogen peroxide and 1 tablespoon of baking soda in a small bowl. Stir well, until the baking soda dissolves. Dip your nails into the solution for 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat once every two weeks.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, mix 2&frac12; tablespoons of baking soda and 1 tablespoon of 3% hydrogen peroxide to make a paste. Use a cotton swab to apply it on your nails. Wait 2 minutes before rinsing your nails with warm water. For best results, repeat once every 2 months.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Treats Body Odor</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Baking soda is one of the best natural deodorizers that help treat mild to severe body odor. It helps absorb moisture and sweat from the skin, thereby reducing body odor. Being an antibacterial agent, it also helps kill bacteria that give rise to body odor.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Combine ⅛&nbsp;teaspoon of baking soda, 1 tablespoon of water and a few drops of any essential oil. Use a cotton ball to rub it on your underarms or areas where you sweat excessively.

Arm yourself with these tools to combat hair fall.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\">Wide-toothed comb</span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Get yourself a wide-toothed comb. This is probably one of the most important yet underutilized of all hair tools. A wide-toothed comb helps you distribute conditioner evenly all over your hair while shampooing and conditioning. In addition, it also helps get rid of knots smoothly.</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>\n<p>The best time to get rid of knots is during conditioning. Apply conditioner and run a wide toothed comb gently through your hair.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>While untangling dry hair, do so in sections. Take one section at a time, and first, untangle the ends of your hair. Do so slowly, and don't pull unless you want your hair to fall out in clumps or break.</li>\n<li>Don't wait for the last minute before detangling your hair. Every night, while sitting in front of the television, run a wide toothed comb gently through your hair, until you have untangled it completely. Do this every night, and you will notice that your hair remains free from tangles.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\">Leave-in conditioner</span></strong> <br />Dry hair tends to tangle easily, and, needless to say, causes it to break. Make sure your hair is never devoid of moisture by always keeping a bottle of leave-in conditioner handy. The next time you feel your hair is dry and rough to the touch, simply rub a dollop of leave-in conditioner between your palms, and apply it to your hair. Comb through with your wide toothed comb. Your hair will be instantly rejuvenated and moisturized. Gradually, the texture will also improve. This is a must if you blow dry your hair regularly, or if it is chemically treated. Such hair constantly craves moisture, so get yourself a bottle of leave-in conditioner.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\">Oil</span></strong> <br /><br />Olive, almond and coconut oils are all excellent for the hair. While you could apply oil as an alternative to leave-in conditioner, oil tends to make your hair sticky, and you cannot style your hair well after applying oil. Your only alternative would then be to tie up your hair. For better results with oil, apply just a few drops immediately after washing your hair, when your hair is still dripping wet. Oil doesn't penetrate the strands as easily as leave-in conditioner does though. Nothing beats a hot oil massage followed by a steam treatment, as the steam helps the oil penetrate the hair strands, strengthening them and curtailing hair fall.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\">Egg</span></strong> <br /><br />Egg is great for the hair - there are no two ways about it! True, it causes a tremendous stink in the bathroom, and your hair may let off an 'eggy' smell, but the results are instantaneous and worth it! Egg strengthens your hair almost immediately, and the egg yolk leaves your hair shining. Whip an egg with two tablespoons of olive oil and apply it to your hair. Wash off after half an hour. Make sure you wash off with cold water though, or the egg will start cooking in your hair, and would be harder to take off! Use a scented shampoo to counter the smell of egg in your hair, and follow up with a leave-in conditioner. Do this for a month, and you will be amazed by the change in your hair texture and the reduction in hair fall.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/hiar1476438656314.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57936332784f768641802ba8","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"falling hair"},{"text":"hair fall"},{"text":"wide-toothed comb"},{"text":"conditioner"},{"text":"oil"},{"text":"egg"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.indiaparenting.com/beauty/article.cgi?art_id=96&sec_id=1","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-14T09:51:09.426Z","udate":"2016-10-14T10:05:30.335Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-14T09:50:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"5800aa8d0eac6818dc69e7fe","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out8550.mp3","tagsForSearch":"falling hair,hair fall,wide-toothed comb,conditioner,oil,egg","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

But it does more than that. It also keeps the possibility of a love life away! Take heart however. There's always Close Up to remedy the situation!</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Garlic contains a chemical called Allicin, which has already proved to have numerous health benefits. A team of Israeli scientists recently used this chemical to successfully kill cancer cells as well as malignant tumors in mice. Allicin is not present in an unbroken clove of garlic. It only gets released when the clove is crushed, so when using garlic in cooking, make sure you crush it and use it. Don't add the entire unbroken clove in your food, as though this will give you the flavour of garlic, it will not provide you with the benefits of its anti-carcinogenic properties. The <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">clove</span> needs to be damaged, so it is more effective crushed than cut. When crushed <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">garlic</span> is added to a dish, any parasites, bacteria or other microbes get killed even before the temperature kills them, so if you are worried about eating outside food - the safest option would be to order food with a strong <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">garlic</span> flavour. Chances of food poisoning would be slim! <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Garlic</span>, as we all know or should be knowing, is a natural antiseptic, and eating a <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">clove</span> of <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">garlic</span> a day also helps ward off most infections.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Italians and Chinese eat plenty of <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">garlic</span> in their food, and have very low incidences of <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">cancer</span>. Pizzas and pastas, Italian dishes rich in maida and cheese, have liberal dozes of <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">garlic</span>, with the result that Italians seem relatively immune to other problems associated with such a diet such as high cholesterol and heart ailments. Similarly, Chinese food is rich in <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">garlic</span>, and the Chinese too are statistically less prone to <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">cancer</span> and heart ailments.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #cc0000;\"><br />How should you eat the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">clove</span>?</span></strong><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Needless to say, crushing a <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">clove</span> of <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">garlic</span> and eating it raw would not be the most pleasant of experiences. <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Garlic</span> has a very strong flavour, and it needs to be mixed with other foods in order to be enjoyed. The best way to eat <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">garlic</span>would be to add it in food while cooking it. Allicin gets distributed throughout the meal, providing you with the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">benefits</span> of its anti-carcinogenic and antiseptic<span class=\"IL_SPAN\">properties</span>.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Make sure you peel the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">garlic</span> before cooking it. Cooking <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">garlic</span> in its peel destroys its curative <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">properties</span>. Similarly, peeling the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">garlic</span> days before and crushing and storing all the crushed <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">garlic</span> together to be used a little at a time may be very convenient as a time saver, but you lose many of garlic's potent health <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">properties</span>. The natural compound of Allicin as found in <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">garlic</span> loses its beneficial <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">properties</span> within hours because it begins to react with garlic's other components as soon as the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">clove</span> is crushed.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #cc0000;\"><br />Peel the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">garlic</span> and let it sit for fifteen minutes before cooking. Just before cooking, crush it. Consume soon after.</span></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">While you can get <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">garlic</span> supplements if you are looking for the easier way out, it is highly recommended that you get your daily doze of <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">garlic</span> the natural way - through the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">clove</span> itself. As already mentioned, <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">garlic</span> has numerous other health <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">benefits</span>, and eating the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">garlic</span> fresh would give you all these <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">benefits</span>. If you can consume the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">garlic</span> raw, there's nothing like it! Peel it, crush it fifteen minutes later and down it, followed by a little milk. Do this every night - so you will not smell of <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">garlic</span> the entire day.

However, most of us are unaware about some easiest ways to treat it. Here are some simple home remedies to combat it.</strong> <br /><br />Bad breath is a common term used to describe unpleasant odours exhaled when a person breathes. Although <a href=\"http://www.indiaparenting.com/childs-healthcare/37_220/oral-hygiene.html\">bad breath</a> is generally associated with the mouth, there may also be cases where the odour originates from the nasal passages. In medical terms, bad breath is referred to as halitosis. According to dentists, it is the third most common reason for people seeking dental assistance, following <a href=\"http://www.indiaparenting.com/childs-healthcare/37_223/easing-the-pain-dealing-with-toothaches-in-children.html\">toothaches</a> and<span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"> <span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">gum disease.</span></span></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /><strong>Causes of <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">halitosis</span></strong> <br /><br /><span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Halitosis</span> affects all people, at some point in their lives. However, <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">halitosis</span>only becomes a problem if it is for a prolonged period or if it is caused by other<span class=\"IL_SPAN\">medical</span> conditions. Transient bad breath is the term given to bad breath, which subsides after brushing one's teeth or rinsing <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the mouth</span> with mouthwash. In this case, bad breath may be caused due to consumption of foods like garlic, cheese, fish, etc. Bad breath also occurs when an individual's mouth is dry due to fasting, stress, or sleeping overnight. <br /><br />Another type of <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">halitosis</span> is chronic bad breath. This is when bad breath persists in spite of a person maintaining good <a href=\"http://www.indiaparenting.com/childs-healthcare/37_1494/how-to-avoid-dental-cavities.html\">oral hygiene</a>. Such bad breath is considered a <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">medical</span> problem. Chronic bad breath is believed to affect thirty percent of all people. Apart from being a <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">medical</span> condition, it can also affect a person's social and professional relationships. <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Halitosis</span> often leads to increased stress and poor self-esteem.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /><strong><span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Home remedies</span> for <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">halitosis</span></strong> <br /><br />The first step to treating <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">halitosis</span> is to find out the cause. If bad breath is due to consumption of a certain food item, avoiding that particular item may be enough to prevent bad breath. If bad breath is being caused by other factors, you may require other modes of treatment. Luckily, there are plenty of <a href=\"http://www.indiaparenting.com/homeremedies/index.shtml\">home remedies</a> to help you out.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /><strong>Fenugreek</strong><br />Fenugreek is the most popular and effective home remedy for bad breath. In local language, fenugreek is called 'methi'. Boil one teaspoon of fenugreek seeds in half a litre of cold water, and allow it to simmer for 15 minutes on a low flame. When it is done, strain the mixture, and use the filtered liquid as a fenugreek tea. Consuming fenugreek tea on a regular basis will gradually diminish bad breath.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /><strong>Avocado</strong><br />Avocado is an excellent remedy for <a href=\"http://www.indiaparenting.com/childs-healthcare/37_219/brush-up.html\">halitosis</a>. Sometimes, due to indigestion, food remains in the intestine. As it decomposes, intestinal bacteria act upon it, which produces various foul gases. When these gases are expelled through<span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the mouth</span>, it <a href=\"http://www.indiaparenting.com/health/324_2652/diabetes-symptoms-causes-and-types.html\">causes</a> bad breath. Consumption of avocado effectively deals with intestinal food decomposition, and thus minimises bad breath.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /><strong>Guava</strong><br />For bad breath caused by <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">gum disease</span>, guava is a treatment option. Besides calcium, manganese, and oxalates, guava is also a good source of malic, oxalic, phosphoric, and tannic acids. Eating guava stops bleeding in the gums and strengthens their hold on the teeth. It also destroys harmful bacteria, residing in the gums. This, in turn, decreases bad breath. Apart from the fruit, chewing the young leaves of the guava tree also stops gums from bleeding.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /><strong>Parsley and clove</strong><br />Parsley is another natural cure for bad breath. Boil two cups of water to which a few sprigs of chopped parsley and a few whole cloves have been added. After boiling, continue stirring the mixture until it cools. Use the liquid obtained after straining as a mouthwash and gargle with it after every meal to keep bad breath at bay.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br /><strong>Juices</strong><br />Juices made of raw fruits or vegetables are important in the fight against<span class=\"IL_SPAN\">halitosis</span>. Juices of green vegetables are especially useful. Individuals who suffer from bad breath should consume raw juices regularly to minimise their<span class=\"IL_SPAN\">halitosis</span>. <br /><br /><span class=\"IL_SPAN\">Home remedies</span> can work wonders for <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">halitosis</span> but they need to be supplemented with good oral hygiene. A combination of regular brushing and flossing along with these dietary methods will ensure that you keep bad breath at bay.</span></p>","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57936332784f768641802ba8","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"home remedies"},{"text":"bad breath"},{"text":"halitosis"},{"text":"oral hygiene"},{"text":"fenugreek"},{"text":"clove"},{"text":"avocado"},{"text":"guava"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.indiaparenting.com/home-remedies/67_2759/home-remedies-for-bad-breath-halitosis.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-14T10:13:44.095Z","udate":"2016-10-14T11:17:57.935Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-14T10:13:00.000Z","title_or_id":"","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"5800afd8dca812202fde4575","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out3146.mp3","tagsForSearch":"home remedies,bad breath,halitosis,oral hygiene,fenugreek,clove,avocado,guava","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Get up and <strong>do something</strong>: change the bedcover, tidy up your cupboard shelves or just walk around.</span></span></li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\"><span lang=\"EN-IN\">When you drive down somewhere, park your car in a far-off spot so you <strong>walk more </strong>to reach your destination. After all, walking is one of the <a href=\"http://www.indiaparenting.com/diet-and-weight-loss/447_4534/top-10-exercises-for-losing-weight.html\">top 10 exercises for weight loss</a>!</span></span></li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\"><span lang=\"EN-IN\"><strong>Stand up </strong>while riding the train or bus, instead of sitting. An average person burns around 140 calories an hour while standing, as opposed to 100 calories an hour while sitting. That may not seem like a huge difference outright, but those additional calories add up to quite a bit, over a period of time. So the next time you are tempted to grab that empty seat in a bus or train, resist, especially if you are in a sedentary job, and have been seated all day anyway.&nbsp;</span></span></li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\"><span lang=\"EN-IN\"><strong>Use the stairs </strong>instead of the elevator or escalator, wherever possible. It makes a world of difference to your fitness level. It strengthens the heart, and is a great workout for your hips, legs and butt.</span></span></li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\"><span lang=\"EN-IN\">Get off the bus or train a few stops early and walk the rest of the way to your destination. Try and get in <strong>at least 20 minutes of walk time </strong>in a day. Two short 10-minute walks everyday add up to 2 hours, 20 minutes of walking time in a week. And if you are not getting any exercise at all, this is a great way to compensate. <a href=\"http://www.indiaparenting.com/health/326_2196/walk-your-way-to-health.html\">Walk your way to good health</a>! Short periods of exercise can be just as effective as one long workout, for certain basic health benefits.&nbsp;</span></span></li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\"><span lang=\"EN-IN\">It never fails to amaze me as to why someone would spend big bucks to <a href=\"http://www.indiaparenting.com/diet-and-weight-loss/447_4257/joining-gym-for-weight-loss.html\">join a gym</a>, and then not do a spot of work at home. <strong>Housework</strong> is the best exercise, and if you don't find time for exercise, then you must try and do some work around the house. Don't depend upon your household helper to make your bed every day; do it yourself.</span></span></li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\"><span lang=\"EN-IN\">The next time you're standing in line, or waiting for someone, take this opportunity to <strong>work your butt</strong>. Tighten your butt muscles, hold to the count of ten, and slowly release. Repeat 6 to 10 times. Make sure you're wearing a skirt, or that your butt is concealed. You don't want people staring at your twitching butt!.</span></span></li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\"><span lang=\"EN-IN\">Okay, here's a bonus 11th tip! What's the best domestic exercise of them all? Sit down on your haunches and <strong>sweep the floor</strong>. That's right! This excellent 'workout' will tighten and strengthen your entire lower body, including pelvic muscles, with the result that if you have been sweeping floors regularly, your labour will be a lot less painful, and you will recover faster.

They try different means to get rid of the belly fat like dieting, avoiding carbohydrates and so on but to no avail. Belly fat is stubborn fat and it takes a lot of patience and our easy tips of losing the belly fat to see the desired effect. By following our easy tips, you can trim away inches from the waist area in no time. Read on.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Losing belly fat seems to be a strenuous prospect for people who wish to trim the inches around their waist. It is seen that men usually end up holding most of their body fat around their waist. It is known by fancy names like love handles, beer belly or pot belly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The stress levels, sedentary work style and lack of physical <a href=\"http://www.indiaparenting.com/pregnancy/122_3040/exercises-for-toning-different-parts-of-the-body.html\">exercise</a> offer their contribution in the development of the potbelly. Belly fat is quite difficult to lose as it is of a stubborn variant and one needs to work hard to effectively reduce it. Given below are certain simple rules that can help you to lose the belly fat with elan:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Avoid Junk Food</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Junk food must be completely thrown away from your menu. The high sugar content of the cookies, brownies and chips are the evil features of junk food. Besides, most of the junk foods carry a huge amount of refined carbohydrates that result in a sharp rise in the blood sugar levels of the body. This slows down the fat burning process and makes you feel hungry. Thus, a vicious circle simply refuses to let you succeed in <a href=\"http://www.indiaparenting.com/health/325_2739/counting-calories-for-weight-loss.html\">weight loss</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Check Your Carbohydrate intake</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Carbohydrates are an essential requirement for our system but there are good and bad crabs that we need to differentiate. The white bread, pasta, donuts, cakes and biscuits are made of refined flour and ought to be avoided. They are not easily digested and cause bloating and eventually result in the accretion of stubborn fat. These are therefore the &lsquo;bad crabs&rsquo;. Fruits and vegetables contain &lsquo;good crabs&rsquo;. Certain pulses, oats and brown rice contain beneficial crabs and as they are released in to the body slowly, it helps in effective digestion too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In order to lose belly fat fast and successfully, you need to ensure that the metabolism level of your body is high enough. So limit your carbs intake as otherwise, it will shoot up your insulin level that will in turn slow down the metabolic rate. Therefore, to avoid this predicament, it is advisable to balance he meals with a fair blend of carbs, proteins and vegetables.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>No Late Night Snacks and Boozes</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Belly fat is directly related to these two culprits. Since there is no activity following the late night snack, the sugar levels in the blood shoot up instantaneously. You need to be on a strict diet if you wish to lose <a href=\"http://www.indiaparenting.com/womens-health/322_3486/how-to-lose-belly-fat-naturally.html\">belly fat</a>. High alcohol consumption leads to the accumulation of fat around the waist. One ml of alcohol has seven calories and is totally devoid of nutrients.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Finally, Exercise!</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is no substitute for regular physical activity. If you lack the motivation to <a href=\"http://www.indiaparenting.com/health/326_2182/top-10-domestic-workouts.html\">workout</a> on your own, you can enroll in a gym or hire a personal trainer. Weight training should be a part of your workout regimen to reduce belly fat. You must also do intensive exercises like interval training and circuit training. Also, remember the fact that belly fat is quite natural. The fat actually provides a cover for the safety of the internal organs. So all exercise must be performed under the monitoring of a certified trainer.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/weight_loss1476440852813.gif","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57936332784f768641802ba8","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"exercises"},{"text":"belly fat"},{"text":"junk food"},{"text":"carbohydrate intake"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.indiaparenting.com/diet-and-weight-loss/447_4299/exercises-for-losing-belly-fat.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-14T10:27:45.845Z","udate":"2016-10-14T11:19:46.584Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-14T10:27:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"5800b3213d0de62016ffbba7","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out1443.mp3","tagsForSearch":"exercises,belly fat,junk food,carbohydrate intake","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Loss of DNA methylation and cellular memory are a hallmark of certain cancers, so a better understanding of how this process occurs could prove significant.<br /><br />\"We are beginning to explore how the vitamin-induced effects we have uncovered in this study might impact on the loss of DNA methylation in certain cancers,\" he said.<br /><br />The study appears in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS).</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/575762_thump1476443512063.gif","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baabc5ecbc9256e95c1763","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"vitamins a"},{"text":"vitamin c"},{"text":"memory"},{"text":"dna"},{"text":"regenerative medicine"},{"text":"stem cell therapy"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/575762/vitamins-c-help-erase-memory.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-14T11:12:05.801Z","udate":"2016-10-14T11:18:41.313Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-14T11:11:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"5800bd8554b6fc09f7618a7d","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out7292.mp3","tagsForSearch":"vitamins a,vitamin c,memory,dna,regenerative medicine,stem cell therapy","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

According to the NYU Langone Medical Center researchers, kids who ate at any of five major fast-food chains consumed 179 more calories on average when their meal deals included soda, sweetened tea or juice, or flavored milks, compared to those who drank non-sweetened beverages or nothing with their food.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Researchers also found that purchasing drinks as part of bundled meals was tied to the consumption on average of 82 more drink calories than when the drinks were purchased separately.

The high calorie levels calculated by the research team among youthful diners mean it is highly likely that added sugar intake from such drinks causes many of them to exceed the maximum, recommended limit of between 120 and 180 calories set in US national dietary guidelines. Elbel points out that about 17% of Americans under the age of 19 are estimated to be obese, a situation caused in part by people's consumption of too many calories from sugar.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The researchers say their analysis is the first to assess factors that may be driving sugary drink consumption at fast-food restaurants. Overall, among those surveyed, fewer than half (42%) purchased a combination meal, but 74% of combo purchases were kids' meal. The survey also found that about half of all beverages (49%) were sodas. The rest were juice (38%), flavored milk (5%), regular milk (2%), and water (1%).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another 5% consisted of sweetened teas, lemonade, and hot chocolate.

Here's how you can get your upper arms in shape:&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Start doing some form of aerobic activity like walking or jogging. Just exercising your arms will not really accomplish much, unless it is combined with aerobic activity. Aerobic activities help you burn fat from all over, and at a much faster rate than spot reduction exercises do. Thus, it's best to combine a spot reduction activity which targets the muscles in your upper arm, with an aerobic exercise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #666600;\">Weights</span></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Invest in a pair of dumbbells.

It's better to stick to something with a handle.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Do you really need weights even if you don't want to build large muscles? The answer is yes. Working with light weights won't increase the size of your biceps and triceps. It will, however, convert the fat into muscle. Muscle helps you lose fat even when you are not working out, so you will be burning those calories while sleeping! Isn't that great?&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">In addition, more muscle means more strength, so you will be able to lift that chair - and table - without calling for help. (We don't recommend it though. You don't want to strain your back muscles.)&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Hold a dumbbell in one arm and lift your upper arm so it is against the side of your head, pressed against your ear. Support it from the front with your other arm, and slowly raise the arm so it is straight up above you. Lower it again, till the dumbbell touches the back of your spinal cord. Do this ten times for each arm, rest, and do two more reps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #666600;\">Pulsing</span></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Stretch your hands straight out on your sides so they are shoulder level. With your palms facing down, pulse them up and down 50 times. Then face your palms out, pulsing back and front, up, pulsing up and down and back, pulsing back and front again. Pulse them 50 times each time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #666600;\">Push-ups</span></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Assume the regular push up pose, with your legs out straight behind you and your arms below your chest on the floor. Keep your arms as close together as possible, with fingers pointing forward. Slowly lower your body till your elbows are bent at 90 degrees, pause for a few seconds, and lift your body again. Start with around 2-3 push ups, and slowly keep increasing. Once this gets too easy, you could keep lowering your body till your chin almost touches the floor, and then lift it again.&nbsp;</span></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/trim-your-upper-arms1476448876661.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57936332784f768641802ba8","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"upper arms"},{"text":"exercise"},{"text":"work outs"},{"text":"push-ups"},{"text":"weights"},{"text":"pulsing"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.indiaparenting.com/health/326_2191/trim-your-upper-arms.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-14T12:41:30.145Z","udate":"2016-10-14T13:08:35.647Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-14T12:41:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"5800d27adca812202fde47ac","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out9987.mp3","tagsForSearch":"upper arms,exercise,work outs,push-ups,weights,pulsing","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

The Basavatarakam Indo-American Cancer Hospital alone gets 400 new patients every year compared to just 150 patients a few years ago.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What compounds the problem of the lack of endocrine surgeons is the almost negligible number of cytopathologists. Thyroid cancer diagnosis requires experienced thyroid cytopathologist who could diagnose thyroid diseases at the cellular level, differentiate non tumour cells and advise for surgery.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh there are just about four cytopathologists and endocrine surgeons. Dr A Zakir Ali, Consultant and Head, Dept. of Nuclear Medicine, Basavatarakam Indo-American Cancer Hospital &amp; Research Institute says, &ldquo;There are many small ill-equipped labs cropping up all over the city providing diagnosis at a low cost. But unless there is accuracy correct treatment is not possible.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For a simple thyroid nodule patients need to go undertake preliminary tests such as thyroid function test, neck ultrasound neck and fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) etc. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy and fine needle capillary sampling are the two most widely used diagnostic techniques for assessing the cytopathology of thyroid nodules to identify those patients who have nodules that should be removed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These procedures are seldom interpreted accurately by inexperienced technicians as it requires in-depth knowledge, understanding and practice.&rdquo; There is a lack of awareness on cytopathology and many medical students too do not opt for endocrinology as a result doctors do not specialise in the field. Surgeries for thyroid carcinoma or parathyroid adenoma are being performed in many cases by surgical oncologists themselves.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr Ashok, a US returned endocrinologist and a consultant to several corporate hospitals says, &ldquo;The main treatment and follow up which is done with radioactive iodine is available only in a very few hospitals. Availability of a nuclear medicine physician is another major challenge. &nbsp;Dr Ali says, &ldquo;If there is a lump in the neck, patients should not ignore. If a thyroid cancer is detected at an early stage, it can be almost completely treated.&rdquo;</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The US is expected to have the highest number of thyroid cases by 2020 in the world, closely followed by India at the third position. Thyroid cancer is much more common in women than in men. About three women are diagnosed for every man and can happen at any stage of adult life. The cure rate for thyroid cancer is around 97-98 percent, he said.&nbsp;</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/thyroid1476505375016.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babc1e73031e7ec856e9a3","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"thyroid"},{"text":"thyroid cancer"},{"text":"thyroid cytopathologist"},{"text":"diseases"},{"text":"tumour cells"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Health/2016-10-15/Shortage-of-doctors-to-tackle-thyroid-cases/258850","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-15T04:23:09.636Z","udate":"2016-10-17T06:06:52.086Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-17T06:06:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"5801af2d6969590e18090151","id":"5801af2d6969590e1809014f","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out7102.mp3","tagsForSearch":"thyroid,thyroid cancer,thyroid cytopathologist,diseases,tumour cells","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

And yet, it might come as a surprise that the resurrection of puppetry, arguably one of the oldest story-telling tropes in the country, can in large part be attributed to the idiot box.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Puppetry as an art form finds early mentions in India&rsquo;s classical texts. One of the earliest references to puppetry is found in the Tamil classic Silappadikaaram written around the 1st or 2nd century BC. One of India&rsquo;s greatest grammarians, Patanjali, refers to puppetry in his defining work on Sanskrit grammar, Mahabhasya, as being one of three dramatic genres. The concept of puppetry can also be found in the Bhagvad Gita, one of India&rsquo;s most revered philosophical treatise that is part of the Mahabharata, which itself is steeped in antiquity.</p>\n<div id=\"rcjsload_10a48f\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;As other art forms such as drama and dance took stage, live puppetry shows gradually took a back seat; today, it lives on in as a super-specialty of sorts, practised only by a handful, watched by even fewer.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Even now when we travel in villages, the older people appreciate the art and tell us that they always wait to see us but not a single child sits down and sees the art we perform. After the increase of electronic channels people get to see it on screen whenever they want, there are few people who like to see the live shows,&rdquo; rues Puran Bhat, a resident of Kathputli Colony&mdash;literally, Colony of Puppeteers&mdash;in New Delhi.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, Bhat, who learnt the art when he was 9, insists that the form itself is not dying, just that the viewership has been reduced due to television and cinema.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At the same time, there are those who maintain that puppetry has got a second lease of life, thanks to television.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Call it the Seventies&rsquo; puppet equivalent of India&rsquo;s Got Talent, but one of Mumbai&rsquo;s oldest and most famous puppets may owe his longevity to TV.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&lsquo;Ardhavatrao&rsquo;, a puppet character created by Yeshwant Keshav Padhye in 1916, and modelled on an eccentric middle-class Marathi man, imagined and created in 1916, might have had a shorter lifespan if it weren&rsquo;t for TV&mdash;he gained a mass following after Doordarshan called Padhye&rsquo;s son Ramdas in 1972 to do a 15-minute show, giving the puppet his first break on national TV.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Ardhavatrao became famous in every household after the Doordarshan show was telecast,&rdquo; admits 70-year-old Ramdas.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On September 24, he opened a new live show&mdash;&lsquo;Carry on Entertainment&mdash;Ramdas Padhye Live&rsquo; as a part of Adhavatrao&rsquo;s centennial birthday celebrations, involving the entire Padhye family, along with 50 puppets and featuring the 40 best acts over the life of the show.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Ardhavatrao is now the eldest member of our family. Since the beginning, all my puppets were kept in my studio but I always keep &lsquo;Ardhavatrao&rsquo; and his wife Awadabai close to me, in my house,&rdquo; says Padhye.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another popular Mumbai ventriloquist/puppeteer, Rajkumar Javkar aka Rajarancho owes his much of his recognition to his first break on the comedy show Laughter Challenge. The 39-year-old mimicry artist earlier worked in a water park before he started acting with his puppet &lsquo;Rancho&rsquo;, again derived from a popular TV detective serial Raja aur Rancho.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Ventriloquism is not that popular in India like it is in foreign countries. Television is the best medium to make this art popular but it depends upon the artist&rsquo;s act and different elements which he uses to make the act entertained,&rdquo; Rajkumar says.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Puppetry has also found more cross-genre usage, helping it stay alive and relevant.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mumbai-based self-taught puppeteer Usha Venkatraman, 55, started using puppets to make children understand Indian classical music. In the beginning, Venkatraman used glove puppets since they were easier to manipulate. But after few years, when she saw paper bag puppets in a festival, she got in touch with the Rajasthan-based artist to customise the puppets for her.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Just by movement, puppets can express themselves. It is a narrative prop to make people understand any story. Besides classical music&rsquo;s melody and rhythm, I started narrating Indian mythology to the school&rsquo;s students,&rdquo; said Venkatraman, who is a trained singer herself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Venkatraman is also helping to revive the art by helping corporates and college students. For the former, she organises motivational seminars using paper bag puppets. According to her, during these sessions, the puppets&rsquo; expressions helps working professionals open up their alter ego, while it helps college students present their presentations in a unique way.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Lack of support</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;India has more than 400 types of puppeteers and most of them have died mainly because it was passed down through generations and the new generation wants to stay in the cities for better jobs,&rdquo; says Shaizia Manekshaw, who conducts puppetry workshops in Mumbai.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;The government&rsquo;s role is minimal and marginal because only a few of these forms are promoted while many traditional forms did not get proper funding and the authorities do not have knowledge of where they are and how to help these artists.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Her views are echoed by Anurupa Roy, a member of the de la Marionnette (UNIMA India), who points out that the government has few funds for puppetry due to a lack of knowledge at the grassroots level. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t have proper information about where the families stay in different corners of the country. There is no survey to see the next generations of the puppeter&rsquo;s family.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;In every state the condition of puppet art different. At present in Kerala shadow puppet tradition is doing very well. In Tamil Nadu, the leather shadow puppets are not in a good situation because there is just one family left because the traditional and ritual context is gone,&rdquo; points out Roy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;In Andhra Pradesh, they have tourism and export industry which buys the puppets. It has become the artefact industry. In some states they have a really good condition while in some states it&rsquo;s really bad. In Odisha, the condition is not good because there is a problem of poverty but some young generations are modernising it. In West Bengal, it is decreasing because of the quality of the show has fallen. They use Tollywood music because of which the puppet shows lost its vibrant,&rdquo; she adds.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But Manekshaw also adds that despite old puppet forms dying out, there&rsquo;s lots happening on the contemporary puppetry scene.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Charting new paths</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some, for example, are keeping the tradition alive not just by making puppets but extending puppet-inspired designs to other handicraft products.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Andhra Pradesh, for example, the Ramayana and Mahabharata were narrated through leather puppets also known as &lsquo;Tholu Bommalata&rsquo;. These puppets were earlier made up of deerskin that has now been replaced by goatskin due to its easier availability. Each of the 60 households of Nimmalakunta village in Anantapur district have at least one leather puppet-maker. These artists can make leather puppets anywhere between 15 inches and 7 feet tall. The characters are driven by scripts and demands during the festival season.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Over the past few years, as demand for live shows has fallen, they have branched out to alternative ways to showcase their art.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Due to TV, there has been decrease in the number of puppet shows since late 90s. Rather than making puppets, we prefer making the art on handicraft materials since it gives us income. Designers from different NGOs come here to teach us various designs which are more in demand in the market,&rdquo; says 48-year-old Rammana Garu.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;We participate in different exhibitions conducted by government and NGOs. Through this we get orders to customize puppets for our customers and reach out to different people,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Puppetry is also critical in keeping another art form alive&mdash;balladeering. The traditional music is also passed on from one generation to another. &ldquo;We create our own techniques rather than updating ourselves from others. While we do the puppet manipulation work, we think how it can be done in a different way depending upon the scripts,&rdquo; says Bhat, who writes his own script and make his own puppets.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;We not only learn to make the puppets but also the music and songs from our elders,&rdquo; says Ramanna. &ldquo;When as a child we involve with our family members to make a puppet or during the show, we get to learn from them about the technique of manipulation, dance form while performing the shows, music and songs too. It is in our genes.&rdquo;</p>\n</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/510291-ramdas-padhye1476506657502.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57bab874ecbc9256e95c1835","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"puppetry"},{"text":"silappadikaaram"},{"text":"patanjali"},{"text":"mahabhasya"},{"text":"bhagvad gita"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57fb6fc4e66f216b816f52ca","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-on-a-string-and-a-prayer-2264147","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-15T04:44:25.969Z","udate":"2016-10-20T12:44:24.253Z","expirydate":"2017-01-01T04:40:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-15T04:39:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"5801b4291f709609dd367f94","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out1071.mp3","audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"puppetry,silappadikaaram,patanjali,mahabhasya,bhagvad gita","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

There are 200 different types of arthritis and they must wise up and realise that arthritis could be a symptom of bigger diseases,\" Head of Department of Rheumatology at AIIMS, Dr Uma Kumar said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She was addressing reporters in New Delhi on the eve of a public lecture on arthritis at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences campus. \"Arthritis can affect any part of the body or any organ, from head to toe. It can trigger heart attacks, stroke or trigger other medical emergency situations, so people should not take it lightly,\" she said. Kumar also said that a proposal is being mooted to declare arthritis as a non-communicable disease (NCD), absence of which is putting severe economic burden on its patients.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Unlike other diseases for which a day or week is dedicated, not much awareness has been raised on arthritis. We do mark World Arthritis Day on October 12 but the area in general lies neglected. Since it is not under NCDs list, there is no national programme for rheumatological illnesses, no comprehensive data on how many people are affected by them. Besides, patients cannot claim reimbursement or insurance, or avail train travel benefits that are enjoyed by people with disability,\" she said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Arthritis affects mostly elderly people but due to change in lifestyle and food habit the young population is also getting affected. There are two most common types of arthritis -- inflammatory arthritis like rheumatoid arthritis and non-inflammatory arthritis like osteoarthritis. Its common symptoms or signs are joint swelling, redness, difficulty in walking and morning stiffness of more than 30 minutes, she said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Obesity and smoking and sedentary lifestyle too are causing arthritis in people. Though there are no epidemiological data available with us, based on recent estimates, 8-23 % of the total population is affected, by it, and even if one takes an average, it is nearly 17 %, which is still a big number,\" Kumar said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She said, for rheumatoid arthritis, women are 10 times more predisposed to be affected by it than men. The AIIMS doctor said that people should not rush to surgeons but go to a physician or rheumatologist first, and only for want of optimum treatment, should they go for surgery. \"It is be the last resort, when the situation becomes worst.\" \"Also, pollution (especially PM2.5) could be cause though there is no long-term research to prove direct link,\" she said.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/arthiritis1476506784008.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57bab874ecbc9256e95c1835","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"arthritis"},{"text":"heart attack"},{"text":"pulmonary infection"},{"text":"aiims"},{"text":"symptom"},{"text":"disease"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.dnaindia.com/health/report-arthritis-can-trigger-heart-attack-pulmonary-infection-aiims-doctor-2264143","shouldDisplayInBrowser":true,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-15T04:46:40.038Z","udate":"2016-10-17T06:06:52.086Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-17T06:06:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"5801b4b0ed1ec1249a5877c9","id":"5801b4b0ed1ec1249a5877c7","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out7662.mp3","tagsForSearch":"arthritis,heart attack,pulmonary infection,aiims,symptom,disease","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

S. Eliot, Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez, Toni Morrison and Samuel Beckett who received the same elite award.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dylan now ages 75 who is the first musician that won this award. It is said that his selection on Thursday is perhaps the most radical choice in a history stretching back to 1901. The Swedish Academy, which awards the prize dramatically, redefined the boundaries of literature. Sara Danius, Swedish Academy's permanent secretary said,&rdquo;Dylan is a great poet in the English-speaking tradition. If you look back, far back, 2,500 years or so, you discover Homer and Sappho and they wrote poetic texts that were meant to be listened to, that were meant to be performed, often with instruments -- and it's the same way with Bob Dylan.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bob is an American songwriter, singer, artist, and writer. He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than 50 years. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when his songs chronicled social unrest, although Dylan repudiated suggestions from journalists that he was a spokesman for his generation. Nevertheless, early songs such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/bob_dylan1476507641507.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"5800c2fd54b6fc09f7618ae1","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"bob dylan"},{"text":"2016 nobel prize"},{"text":"literature"},{"text":"songwriter"},{"text":"blown in the wind"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57fb6fc4e66f216b816f52ca","status":"Discarded","sourceUrl":"http://www.newsbharati.com/Encyc/2016/10/14/Bob-Dylan-Nobel-Prize","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-15T05:00:49.576Z","udate":"2016-10-17T07:14:40.461Z","expirydate":"2017-02-01T04:56:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-15T04:56:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"5801b8010631da5df9127ba4","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"tagsForSearch":"bob dylan,2016 nobel prize,literature,songwriter,blown in the wind","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

{"_id":"5801be021f709609dd368002","title":"Do your joints hurt?","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e4358d3f458eaf4410d","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"justify\"><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that cannot be cured completely. But the pain and swelling can be managed, writes Dr B G Dharmanand</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"justify\">Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease where the immune system of the body mistakenly attacks the healthy joints. This leads to inflammation of the tissue that protects the joints, causing swelling, pain and discomfort. The worldwide prevalence of the disease is 0.8% and jumps to 5% among women over the age of 70. In India, 0.7% of the population is affected by rheumatoid arthritis, while the disease is two to three times more common in women. As the disease causes pain that ranges from burning to throbbing to excruciating, it is crucial that patients consult a rheumatologist early to get diagnosed and treated.<br /><br />Our bones are connected to each other with the help of joints, which allow us to bend, stretch, twist and turn our wrists, fingers, hands and legs. The ends of the joints are protected by a cushion like substance that allows smooth movement, without any friction. The inner surface of the joints contains a fluid called synovium that nourishes and lubricates the joints. <br /><br />When affected by rheumatoid arthritis, the immune system mistakenly attacks the joints, fluid and tissues that protect the joints. This causes inflammation leading to pain and swelling. The disease affects the smaller joints of the hands and feet first, later moving to big joints like knees and hips. In the later stages, there is a chance that the patient&rsquo;s fingers and toes might get deformed.<br /><br /><strong>Causes and symptoms</strong><br /><br />Researchers are still trying to find out why a person&rsquo;s immune system starts attacking the healthy joints of the body. Some postulates about the causes of rheumatoid arthritis include environmental factors such as smoking, periodontitis (a dental condition), hormonal issues and genetic factors. The very early symptoms of the disease may not be distinct; however one can look out for the following signs to confirm rheumatoid arthritis:<br /><br />* Stiffness in joints early in the morning, after waking up that lasts for more than 30 minutes.<br /><br />* Joint pain, redness, stiffness that lasts for more than six weeks at a stretch.<br /><br />* Pain in smaller joints such as wrists and knuckles. <br /><br /><strong>Diagnosis and treatment </strong><br /><br />Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis take time to develop and the initial signs are joint ache, swelling and stiffness. Patients may also feel fatigued. Consult a rheumatologist who, with the help of your medical history, X-rays, physical and laboratory tests, will diagnose you. <br /><br />Rheumatoid arthritis is mainly treated with disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Methorexate, hydroxychloroquine, sulphasalazine and leflunomide are some options. These drugs have an acceptable safety and good efficacy. <br /><br />Starting treatment before deformities show (early in the course) improves their efficacy. Contrary to popular belief, steroids are used only for a short period, particularly for quick response and restoration of function. Most patients don&rsquo;t need steroids.<br /><br />Since rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder, curing it completely is still unlikely. Hence, the following approach is used by doctors to provide maximum comfort and relief to the patients:<br /><br />* Slowing down inflammation and swelling.<br /><br />* With the help of medication, such as DMARDs, a reduction in signs and symptoms of arthritic swelling is achieved.<br /><br />* Non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly prescribed for pain relief.<br /><br />* Research has shown that having a tight control over rheumatoid arthritis can prevent further damage to the joints. It has also shown that the sooner treatment is begun after the diagnosis, the lesser the joint damage. It is also important that the patients avoid any activity that can lead to its further the damage, like squatting. <br /><br />* Surgery is advised to rheumatoid arthritis patients who have permanently damaged their joints and have decreased or hindered mobility. Joint and hip replacement surgeries are commonly done, but surgery can be performed on any dysfunctional joint.<br /><br />* It is extremely important that patients keep themselves physically active, or else immobility can set in quickly. Daily exercises such as walking, yoga or swimming are recommended.<br /><br />* Lowering physical and mental stress is important. <br /><br />Rheumatoid Arthritis is featured in the top 12 most disabling diseases by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

{"_id":"5801c1460631da5df9127bf9","title":"How to survive the downward spiral of anxiety","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e90b17dbb41078bba9f","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Population studies highlight a surge in the use of antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication in women, while clinicians see increasingly complex presentations of stress, anxiety and depression in female patients.<br /></strong><br />Societal patterns and trends over the past decade &ndash; like the early onset of puberty in girls, easy access to the internet, precocious sexual awareness or experimentation, reconstituted and single parent families &ndash; affect vulnerable groups like women and children.<br /><br />The Epidemiological Catchment Areas Study found that generalised anxiety is more likely to present in women and in those with childhood fears or marital or sexual disturbances. Panic attacks are twice as common in women, while hormonal changes during puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and menopause cause bloating, weight gain, stress, anxiety and mood disturbances.<br /><br />One study associated psychiatric disturbances with a multifactorial genesis (incorporating a cultural context) in women. In men, on the other hand, it was linked directly to workplace bullying. Certain societal expectations haunt women throughout their lives, even in an evolving and increasingly cosmopolitan society like ours. Achieving work-life balance after motherhood remains a challenge. There is documented evidence of higher rates of suicidal ideation and attempts of suicide in the lesbian population.<br /><br />Women respond differently to stress and are significantly more likely to eat more. This leads to weight gain and body image problems that further heighten stress. Women reportedly talk more to family and friends to cope with job-related stress. Hence, their self-worth may hinge on the response of their support network.<br /><br />Telltale signs of stress and anxiety include worries or fears that are out of proportion, avoidance of the feared situation and lack of control. Bodily symptoms (fluttering heart, queasy tummy, shaking hands, sweating, recurrent headaches) can confuse matters by mimicking a physical illness. Frustration and anger may affect personal relationships, initiating a vicious downward spiral. <br /><br />Stress in women can be heralded by emotionality; altered appetite, sleep or sex drive; poor self care and low energy, motivation, self-esteem or confidence. Taking practical, supported steps in a timely manner will help address the problem.<br /><br /><strong>How to manage stress<br /></strong><br />See your doctor: Ensure there are no serious medical symptoms that may be masquerading as signs of stress. If psychological, try not to worry about stigma and see a psychiatrist early.<br /><br />Know triggers to stress: Knowing our responsiveness or adaptation style is the first step towards effective stress management. Try not to blame or judge yourself harshly. Focus on building your self-worth and independence with awareness, time and practice. Practice self-reliance, build a tool box of coping strategies and a good support network with the help of a professional or a supportive friend.<br /><br />Work to live, not live to work: A consistent,&nbsp;regulated pace of work and life helps. Take brief breaks during the day. Leave work on time. If you are working from home, have a designated workspace, with time and space boundaries. Slot relaxation into your daily schedule. <br /><br />Stay active and organised: Daily walks increase cardiovascular fitness <br />and release serotonin, the&nbsp;feel-good chemical that reduces anxiety and improves your mood. Planning ahead and sleeping on time can reduce anticipatory stress.<br /><br />Be creative: Healthcare studies show that music and art in personal lives or the environment promote mental health and recovery from illness. Creative arts can reduce the impact of illness or pain. Research suggests that a combination of music and well-evidenced therapeutic techniques may be a useful adjunct for anxiety, depression, adjustment and emotionality.<br /><br />Share and give: Connective, sharing experiences release the hormone <br />oxytocin. Community work&nbsp;is great for socialisation, confidence, self-worth <br />and timely support. Everyone&rsquo;s upbringing and environment is different. Generalisations are not helpful. Simplifying your life and strengthening your mind can contribute to enduring benefits on mind and body, quality of life and satisfaction.<br /><br /><strong><em>(The author is a senior consultant psychiatrist and medical educator, National Health Service, UK)</em></strong></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/anxiety1476510015759.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baabc5ecbc9256e95c1763","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"anxiety"},{"text":"antidepressants"},{"text":"anti-anxiety"},{"text":"medication"},{"text":"stress"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/573350/how-survive-downward-spiral-anxiety.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-15T05:40:22.683Z","udate":"2016-10-17T05:36:25.525Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-17T05:36:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"5801c1460631da5df9127bfb","id":"5801c1460631da5df9127bf9","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out2540.mp3","tagsForSearch":"anxiety,antidepressants,anti-anxiety,medication,stress","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Shahnaz Husain suggests home remedies that can help you get rid of them</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"justify\">We are all born with good skin. A baby&rsquo;s skin is soft, smooth and free of blemishes. As we grow older, factors like diet, lifestyle and physiological changes bring about new problems. Adolescence is a time when the bod witnesses a lot of hormonal activity. This stimulates the oil glands under the skin, causing excess secretion that leads to oily skin and all the problems that come with it. This makes skin look dull and prone to blackheads, spots, pimples and acne. <br /><br />As a teenager, it&rsquo;s important to understand your skin and give it the care it needs. Recognise the value of professional care and seek help in good time. But before it comes to that, here are things you can do to ensure better skin health.<br /><strong><br />Exercise &amp; diet</strong><br /><br />Good health and physical fitness are imperative for glowing skin. Daily exercise gives you a healthy glow by improving blood circulation to the surface. It also helps oxygenate the tissues. Begin by doing deep breathing exercises like pranayama. But check with your doctor first . Adequate sleep is a beauty treatment in itself. <br /><br />Diet plays an important role too. Sweets, chocolates, fizzy drinks and fried foods can have a detrimental effect on your skin health. Lack of fibre in your diet can lead to a congested system, which gives rise to dullness and breakouts. To avoid this, include fruits, raw vegetable salads and sprouts in your&nbsp; diet. Drink plenty of water and take fresh fruit juices diluted with water. Add lemon juice to a glass of warm water and have it first thing in the morning.<br /><br /><strong>Cleanse regularly</strong><br /><br />Cleansing is key for adolescent skin. Your pores must be kept free of hardened oil. Use a face wash or cleanser that is specially formulated for oily skin. Use plenty of water to wash off all traces of the cleanser. <br /><br />Buy astringent lotion and mix it equal parts of rose water and keep it in the fridge. After cleansing, tone the skin daily with this chilled toner, using cotton wool pads. Clean the face and then pat the skin briskly with the rose water-soaked cotton wool pads. This improves blood circulation to the skin and gives you a fresh glow.<br /><br />A salon clean-up includes removal of stubborn blackheads. It helps prevent acne. What many people may not know is that acne starts with a blackhead. Neglected blackheads irritate the surrounding tissues of the skin, resulting in inflammation. This sets the stage for pimples and acne. <br /><br />A single pimple does not mean you have acne. Pimples occur on the surface and they may just signify inflammation, but in acne, there is bacterial activity and therefore, infection. Seek treatment in good time. <br /><br />A &lsquo;pick-me-up&rsquo; face mask can leave your skin clean and glowing. When the skin looks dull, mix lemon juice and egg white and apply it on the face. Wash off with water after 20 minutes. Then give the skin a compress with the cold rose water-soaked cotton wool pads.<br /><br /><strong>Scrub to brighten</strong><br /><br />Use a facial scrub twice a week. This helps cleanse pores and brighten the skin. It also helps in dislodging blackheads. Avoid scrubs on pimples, acne or rash.<br /><br />Make a facial scrub with walnut powder and one teaspoon each of rose water and curd. Apply the mixture on the face and leave it on for a few minutes. Then, rub gently in small circular movements and then wash off with plenty of water. Mix Multani mitti with rose water and apply the paste on the face, avoiding the lips and the area around the eyes. Wash it off when it is dry. For combination skin, apply the mask on oily areas of the skin. <br /><br />Fruit packs are also great for adding radiance to the skin. Mix grated apples with ripe papaya pulp and mashed banana. Apply it on the face and leave it on for half an hour. Wash it off with plain water. It not only adds a glow, but also removes tan and softens the skin.<br /><br />Skin care may seem like a boring routine. But, your skin is your responsibility, so learn to take care of it.<br /><em><br />(The author is a beauty expert)</em></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/skkin1476510147568.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baabc5ecbc9256e95c1763","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"adolescents"},{"text":"blackheads"},{"text":"pimples"},{"text":"shahnaz husain"},{"text":"home remedies"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/575834/how-sooteenage-skin.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-15T05:42:34.164Z","udate":"2016-10-17T05:36:25.525Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-17T05:36:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"5801c1ca1f709609dd36801e","id":"5801c1ca1f709609dd36801c","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6178.mp3","tagsForSearch":"adolescents,blackheads,pimples,shahnaz husain,home remedies","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

The truth, however, is that they are packed with a wide range of nutrients, minerals like calcium and iron, antioxidants, proteins and vitamins that are essential for good health. </strong><br /><br />Although there are seven kinds of macadamia nuts that are grown across the world, only two are edible. They are known to be sweeter and larger than most nuts and can be eaten raw, roasted or cooked. Eating these nuts on a regular basis can have a positive effect on one&rsquo;s health. Here are some of the benefits of macadamia nuts:<br /><br />* Heart health: These nuts are rich in healthy monounsaturated fats that help protect the heart by reducing cholesterol levels and cleaning out the arteries. They also help lower triglyceride levels in your body, and as a result, the risk of coronary diseases is reduced. <br /><br />* Weight loss: The presence of palmitoleic acid, a type of monounsaturated fatty acid, and omega-7 fatty acid in the nuts helps control the burning of fat and curbs appetite.<br /><br />* Free radicals: There is an abundance of antioxidants such as squalene and vitamin E in macadamia nut oil. These help prevent the damage that free radicals may cause by absorbing them.<br /><br />* Gut health: With 7% dietary fibre, macadamia nuts not only bring about a feeling of fullness, but also provide roughage that takes the toxins out of the body. As a result, the nuts also aid digestion. <br /><br />* Young skin: Macadamia nut oil is rich in palmitoleic fatty acid that delays the process of ageing.<br /><br />* Immunity: Macadamia nuts are rich in flavonoids, which help in preventing cell damage caused by environmental toxins. When ingested, flavonoids get converted into antioxidants. In this form, they protect the body from various diseases by eradicating free radicals.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/575830_thump1476510360869.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baabc5ecbc9256e95c1763","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"macadamia nuts"},{"text":"fatty"},{"text":"healthy"},{"text":"nutrients"},{"text":"minerals"},{"text":"calcium"},{"text":"iron"},{"text":"antioxidants"},{"text":"proteins"},{"text":"vitamins"},{"text":"good health"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/575830/loaded-nutrition.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-15T05:46:08.186Z","udate":"2016-10-17T05:36:25.525Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-17T05:36:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"5801c2a054b6fc09f7618fcb","id":"5801c2a054b6fc09f7618fc9","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6186.mp3","tagsForSearch":"macadamia nuts,fatty,healthy,nutrients,minerals,calcium,iron,antioxidants,proteins,vitamins,good health","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

The red scaly patches don&rsquo;t just make you feel uncomfortable but also frustrate you, as you might have tried all possible treatments. Psoriasis is a disorder of the immune system and approximately 0.5 to 0.25% of the country&rsquo;s population is affected by this. </strong><br /><br />When affected by psoriasis, an individual&rsquo;s immune system starts acting against his or her own tissues, which triggers the release of chemicals that often cause inflammation, redness, itching and flaky skin patches. <br /><br />If conventional treatment options haven&rsquo;t worked for you, you can consider biologics. The most advanced treatment available today, it is a protein-based medication made from living cells cultured in a laboratory.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>Effective and safe</strong><br /><br />Biologics is a new-age treatment which is effective in most cases but due to the high cost of the medicines, their use is limited to patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. <br /><br />Biological medications are specifically designed to mimic chemicals that are naturally found in the human body and act to set whatever is going wrong right. These drugs interfere with the immune system malfunction that causes psoriasis by blocking the abnormal activity of T-cells. Biologics can be taken through an injection on the leg, abdomen or arm, or intravenously.<br /><br />Biological medicines are given at defined intervals. The interval between doses is dependent on each individual. The sessions may last anywhere between two to six months, depending on the severity of the condition. <br /><br />While biological medications are very effective in treating psoriasis, it is important to discuss their pros and cons with your dermatologist. <br /><br /><strong>Pros </strong><br /><br />Keep the following points in mind while considering the new treatment option:<br /><br />* Biologics can be taken in conjunction with other psoriasis treatments such as topical medication and pain relievers. However, it&rsquo;s crucial to consult your doctor before combining therapies because they may interact with medications you take for other conditions.<br /><br />* One potential advantage to being treated with biologics is less need for blood tests than with some other psoriasis treatments.<br /><br />* Biologics are given less frequently and once injected or infused intravenously, they may act more quickly than some other treatments.<br /><br /><strong>Cons</strong><br /><br />* If your immune system is compromised or you have an active infection, it&rsquo;s likely that you won&rsquo;t be able to take biologics. In some situations, biologics can increase the risk of infection.<br /><br />* For those who do start biologic treatment, some side effects are possible.<br />n Women who are taking biologics are advised not to become pregnant unless advised by your dermatologist. <br /><br />In general, biologics may represent a step forward in the treatment of psoriasis by allowing more people to better manage the condition. <br /><br />As for determining which biologic may be right for you, speak to your doctor. Biologics are usually taken continuously or as prescribed to maintain improvement.<br /><br />It is recommended that patients on biological medication be monitored. They should have routine blood tests at least every six months or so, including full blood count and liver function tests. In few cases, screening for latent tuberculosis is also recommended.<br /><br /><em>(The author is dermatologist, Sir Gangaram Hospital, New Delhi)</em></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/itches1476510522318.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baabc5ecbc9256e95c1763","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"itches"},{"text":"dr rohit batra"},{"text":"psoriasis"},{"text":"skin"},{"text":"red scaly patches"},{"text":"immune system"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Discarded","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/575828/way-treat-itches.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-15T05:48:49.304Z","udate":"2016-10-17T07:34:48.276Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-17T05:36:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"5801c34154b6fc09f7618fd7","id":"5801c34154b6fc09f7618fd5","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out9154.mp3","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"tagsForSearch":"itches,dr rohit batra,psoriasis,skin,red scaly patches,immune system","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

The recognition that lyrics too are literature is clearly heartening for a large majority with strings attached to music. Closer home, musicians turn vocal about the artiste and his contribution to literature as well as humanity. Is this a new beginning?&nbsp; </strong><br /><br />Louiz Banks, the man who spearheaded the jazz movement in India, is elated. &ldquo;This has brought me great joy and happiness. It is historic and unprecedented,&rdquo; he exclaims. &ldquo;Dylan&rsquo;s lyrics are those concerning people, the society, his vision for the future, and he put all these elements together in his songs. He may not be a great singer but his lyrics are anthems.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Although I am not a jazz man and I hardly played his music, except the jazz version of Blowin&rsquo; in The Wind, I love them all. He sort of inspires the rest of us. He is a poet and the honour is appropriate,&rdquo; adds the composer.<br /><br />The debate is looming large and that is on whether lyrics can be poems and whether they can be considered on par with literary works. Meanwhile, violinist, composer and conductor L Subramaniam considers Dylan &ldquo;so much more than a musician. He has been a voice of generations. I have always known that lyrics are poetry, lyrics are literature and it&rsquo;s very meaningful that for the first time, a songwriter has received the &lsquo;Nobel Prize for Literature&rsquo;,&rdquo; he says while singer Kavita Krishnamurthy Subramaniam adds, &ldquo;Bob Dylan has always been a creative thinking musician and I&rsquo;m happy the importance of artists like him, who have the ability to change society through their words, is now being recognised.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />With the boundaries between literature and music now seemingly blurring and cultural walls being broken, many see it as a new beginning. Grammy-winning musician Ricky Kej cannot hide his excitement and his reverence for the artiste. &ldquo;The Nobel committee has broadened its view of literature,&rdquo; he says.<br /><br />&ldquo;Dylan&rsquo;s writing,&rdquo; he explains, &ldquo;has been about showcasing honesty in an intelligent manner and sometimes, in profound ways. He is ahead of his time and clearly timeless. His words and music have inspired generations of not just musicians, but also poets, authors, artists and filmmakers. There have been novels dedicated to deciphering the meanings of his songs. No one in my opinion deserves the award more than him because he has used language in a way no one has ever managed to.&rdquo; <br /><br />Gary Lawyer, the veteran rocker and the man often described as the Jim Morrison of India, minces no words in his appreciation of the honour and its timeliness.<br /><br />&ldquo;Awarding the Nobel to Dylan is kind of paying homage to intellectual, social and emotional music,&rdquo; he says. Lawyer finds poetry in Dylan&rsquo;s lyrics and a deep meaning in his music. &ldquo;The delivery is so unique,&rdquo; he elaborates. &ldquo;It covers all aspects of life, from intellectual and social to political and emotional.&rdquo; However, Lawyer does not believe that this will open a gateway for musicians to win such an honour. &ldquo;Because there is only one Bob Dylan. As I am a singer, I see the singer in him as opposed to a stylist which is also what he is. But I don&rsquo;t think he was ever meant to be a humanitarian. Probably, he would laugh it off. In terms of awareness, it is amazing how he put words into his lyrics. As a musician, he also brought in a new style, a product of its kind,&rdquo; he avers. <br /><br />&ldquo;These days, you see a lot of singing in Bob Dylan&rsquo;s vein. But his music is the nucleus from where it arose.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s an ever-changing&nbsp; chameleon, be it his music or looks. You will probably never know who the real person is,&rdquo; adds Lawyer.

Dr Sanjay Kalra offers tips to ensure effective absorption","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e4358d3f458eaf4410d","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Insulin injections play a major role in diabetes management. Here are some tips that will help you make sure you are doing it right:</strong><br /><br />* Insulin needs to be injected into fatty areas (subcutaneously), and not into muscles (it hurts more and insulin gets absorbed faster leading to risk of lowered blood sugar). Also, do not inject into scar tissue, swollen areas, moles, nerves, varicose veins or bruises.<br /><br />* There are a few areas that are most preferable, in order of how fast insulin is absorbed into the body: the abdomen, the back of the upper arms, the fleshy part of the thighs and the buttocks.<br /><br />* Know about the correct positions and the injection technique. On the abdomen, stay three inches away from belly button. On the thighs, the front and outer areas are the best options. On the arms, you may inject into fatty tissue between the shoulder and the elbow. On the buttocks, strictly avoid the lower area.<br /><br />* Make sure to keep the time of day and body part consistent. For instance, if your morning dose is given in the arms, then continue to do this every morning. Your afternoon site may be the thighs.<br /><br />* Move the next injection site at least at a finger&rsquo;s distance from the previous site. Or else, there is a possibility of developing hard lumps or fatty deposits which can change the way insulin is absorbed.<br /><br />* When injecting, keep muscles relaxed. Do not massage the spot after injection.<br />n If you are into sports or strenuous physical activities, don&rsquo;t inject insulin into an area which is affected by the exercise you are doing. For example, if you plan to jog after your morning injection, avoid inserting insulin in your thighs.<br /><br />* Get a clear idea from your doctor about the size of the needle and the injection schedule that you need to follow. If you are not comfortable with syringes, speak to your doctor and try out other delivery options such as pens or pumps.<br /><br />* With syringes, the correct technique is to pinch the area using only your thumb and index finger and taking a couple of inches of skin and fat. Insert the needle at a 90-degree angle, so it doesn&rsquo;t go into the muscle. Push the plunger in, release skin, and remove needle after counting slowing till 10. Then release the pinch-up.<br /><br />* If you&rsquo;re bleeding or the injection is hurting, do check with your doctor about your insertion technique. Also, re-use of needles causes pain. Insulin needs to be at room temperature, or else it may hurt.<br /><br />* Never reuse a needle &mdash; it could be blunted, can break and get lodged in the skin, or be bent. Also, don&rsquo;t share needles.<br /><br />* Store insulin right. Keep them at room temperature (59&deg; to 86&deg;F) for one month after opening. Do not store insulin in direct sunlight, the freezer, near air-conditioning vents, heating devices or radiators. You can store unopened vials or pens in the refrigerator.<br /><br /><em>(The author is with the department of endocrinology, Bharti Hospital, Karnal)</em></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/insulin1476510707937.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baabc5ecbc9256e95c1763","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"insulin"},{"text":"injections"},{"text":"diabetes management"},{"text":"fatty areas"},{"text":"muscles"},{"text":"blood sugar"},{"text":"scar tissue"},{"text":"swollen areas"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/575827/injecting-insulin.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-15T05:51:54.866Z","udate":"2016-10-17T05:36:25.525Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-17T05:36:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"5801c3fa0631da5df9127c27","id":"5801c3fa0631da5df9127c25","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","tagsForSearch":"insulin,injections,diabetes management,fatty areas,muscles,blood sugar,scar tissue,swollen areas","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

The evening will feature pure classical music as well as some fun scores from famous Hollywood movies.</strong><br />&nbsp; <br />There will be a 30-member string orchestra joined by piano as well as a few wind accompaniments. They will perform classics from modern composers like Christoph Willibald Gluck, Kurt Atterberg and Gustav Holst and scores from famous blockbusters such as &lsquo;The Godfather&rsquo; and &lsquo;The James Bond&rsquo; themes. This concert celebrates the art of storytelling through music. <br /><br />The Bangalore School of Music Chamber Orchestra hasn&rsquo;t performed in the city for over two years now and that&rsquo;s also one of the reasons this concert is special, says Sibi Venkataraju, co-founder, Toit Foundation for the Arts, and a musician himself. He explains, &ldquo;There have been limited opportunities for the Chamber Orchestra to perform in the city. Unlike for other genres of music, there are few accessible and inexpensive spaces for performance. That means any concert requires a fair amount of sponsorship funds. When sponsorship comes in, there isn&rsquo;t a long-term commitment, which makes it difficult to set a calendar of events. And that is what we are looking to change,&rdquo; says Sibi. <br /><br />Sibi says that the aim of the entire set of concerts that the two organisations have set out to do is to get more people to listen to and appreciate&nbsp; Western classical music. &ldquo;So the concert will have traditional classical music as well as something contemporary. We wanted people who are coming in for a Western classical orchestra concert for the first time to have something that they can relate to,&rdquo; he says explaining the intention behind putting the concert together. &ldquo;There have been a lot of classics from great composers that have been extensively used in movies. And there are also a lot of movie scores inspired from such composers. Background scores have always lifted the drama unfolding on the screen and a lot of the great scores are easily relatable to many people,&rdquo; he adds.<br /><br />Most of the compositions for the latest concert have been chosen to tell interesting stories. &ldquo;For instance, a piece called &lsquo;Iphigenia en Aulide Overture&rsquo; is a story of Agamemnon having to sacrifice his own daughter. Knowing these stories will help people follow the piece more closely,&rdquo; Sibi adds.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/575807_thump1476510909896.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baabc5ecbc9256e95c1763","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"toit foundation"},{"text":"arts"},{"text":"bangalore school of music"},{"text":"classical music concert"},{"text":"october 16"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57fb6fc4e66f216b816f52ca","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/575807/on-classical-note.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-15T05:55:16.757Z","udate":"2016-10-20T12:47:04.926Z","expirydate":"2017-02-01T05:52:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-17T07:05:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"5801c4c4ed1ec1249a5878b1","id":"5801c4c4ed1ec1249a5878af","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","audioImageUrl":"","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"tagsForSearch":"toit foundation,arts,bangalore school of music,classical music concert,october 16","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

It imparts a strong character to the dish with its distinctive aroma and flavour. Native to the central Asiatic regions, hing is extracted as an oleo-resin from the sap of stems and roots of the Apiacacae family.</strong><br /><br />The resin, which is greyish in colour when fresh, turns a light brown when dried. In this condition, it is very hard and does not yield to regular chopping or grating. Hence, it is often powdered and used. <br /><br />As it is pungent, a pinch or two is sufficient while tempering a dish. Despite the small quantity in which it is used, hing has medicinal properties and is referred to as sahasravedhi (effective in thousand ways). Here are some of its benefits:<br /><br />When combined with a glass of buttermilk, it is found to relieve digestive disturbances and cure bloating, <br /><br />flatulence and indigestion. It can also be used in the treatment of intestinal worms.<br />Due to its anti-inflammatory properties, asafoetida is a popular home remedy for menstrual cramps.<br /><br />When combined with honey and ginger, asafoetida is beneficial in treating respiratory discomforts like chest congestion.<br /><br />Application of a paste of powdered hing and lemon juice helps mitigate toothache.<br />Sulphur and anti-coagulant compounds found in asafoetida help in maintaining a healthy circulatory system, which ensures a healthy heart. <br /><br />When taken along with bittergourd juice, it regulates blood sugar and cholesterol levels.<br /><br />As it is anti-bacterial and anti-fungal, hing is used in treating inflamed skin, rashes and corns by acting as a soothing agent.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/asofoetida1476512182727.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baabc5ecbc9256e95c1763","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"asafoetida"},{"text":"hing"},{"text":"indian cuisines"},{"text":"aroma"},{"text":"flavour"},{"text":"oleo-resin"},{"text":"apiacacae"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/574667/many-benefits-asafoetida.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-15T06:16:29.564Z","udate":"2016-10-17T05:36:25.525Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-17T05:36:00.000Z","title_or_id":"","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"5801c9bded1ec1249a5878e7","id":"5801c9bded1ec1249a5878e5","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","tagsForSearch":"asafoetida,hing,indian cuisines,aroma,flavour,oleo-resin,apiacacae","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Many people think that they are one and the same when in reality they are not.</strong><br /><br />The key difference is in the way these fermented milk products are manufactured. Curd is prepared by fermenting milk with lactobacillus bacteria, while in yoghurt, two strains of bacteria called Lactobacillus bulgaris and Streptococcus thermophilus are used. Different strains of bacteria produce different kinds of yoghurt in terms of taste, texture and consistency.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yoghurt is gaining popularity among the masses as an easy-to-consume, fresh and milk-based product that delivers a combination of nutrients that ensure good digestive health. In fact, even people who are lactose intolerant can consume yoghurt in small quantities depending on the severity of their condition. This is because most of the lactose in yoghurt is converted to lactic acid by the bacteria.<br /><br /><strong>Beneficial </strong><br /><br />Yoghurt has numerous nutrients that help in creating a balance in our daily diet. While it provides vitamins and minerals, it is relatively low in calories. Here are some of the other benefits of yoghurt:<br /><br />As it contains live bacteria, it supports digestion and improves gut health. <br />Being a milk-based product, yogurt is a source of nutrients including proteins, calcium, zinc, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium and vitamins that makes it an essential part of a balanced diet. Thanks to its high nutrient density, yoghurt makes a healthy snack.<br /><br />Yogurt helps in quenching thirst and reducing hunger as it is satiating. It also acts as an energiser due to higher simple sugar level.<br /><br />It is easily digested and aids in better digestion as well. <br /><br />Yogurt helps in restoring intestinal flora. It not only manages weight gain but also lowers hypertension and diabetes risk over time.<br /><br />Nutrition experts say 200 grams of plain yoghurt can deliver 6 grams of protein and a whopping 240 milligrams of calcium. <br /><br />Plus, yoghurt also sets up an efficient little factory in the intestinal tract and manufactures vitamin B, thus delivering a stockpile of essential vitamins.<br /><br />With so many benefits and nutrients, it is no wonder that the name yoghurt is derived from the Turkish word yogurur, which means long life.<br /><br /><strong><em>(The author is the medical director, Danone Nutricia)</em></strong></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/YOGHURT1476513286595.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baabc5ecbc9256e95c1763","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"grocery store"},{"text":"curd"},{"text":"yoghurt"},{"text":"cold storage"},{"text":"bacteria"},{"text":"lactobacillus bulgaris"},{"text":"streptococcus thermophilus"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/574670/health-booster.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-15T06:34:52.700Z","udate":"2016-10-17T05:36:25.525Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-17T05:36:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"5801ce0c0eac6818dc69f068","id":"5801ce0c0eac6818dc69f066","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out5670.mp3","tagsForSearch":"grocery store,curd,yoghurt,cold storage,bacteria,lactobacillus bulgaris,streptococcus thermophilus","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

Mosul, home to up to 1.5 million people, has been the headquarters of Islamic State's self-declared caliphate in northern Iraq since 2014 and the militants are making complex preparations to prevent Iraqi security forces, backed by a US-led coalition, taking it back.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The battle for the city, expected later this month, will help shape the future of Iraq and the legacy of US President Barack Obama.

Mosul residents said the militants have also dug a two metre by two metre trench around the perimeter of the city to be filled with burning oil to make air strikes more difficult. Aid groups have expressed concern over the prospect that many civilians could be killed in the fighting.

It also asked devotees to immerse idols after removing decorative and non-biodegradable items.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">But to no avail. \"People violated all the guidelines, which will certainly increase pollution levels in the river,\" a BSPCB official said.

Plaster of Paris does not dissolve easily and contains harmful substances such as gypsum, sulphur, phosphorus and magnesium.

{"_id":"5801df4df568d50da51e5c35","title":"Governance deficit in God’s own country","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8fde34a4ac2d218b1a5c","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pinarayi is the name of a village in Kerala's Kannur district &nbsp;(old Malabar region). The village is the birth place and falls in the Dharmadom constituency of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Bu t, the place is in now in the news for brutal political killings. It was here 26-year-old Remith, a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) worker, was hacked to death on Wednesday morning around 10 am near a petrol pump when he was returning home.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Remith was found in a pool of blood, said reports in local dailies. He was lying unattended, with blood oozing out of deep cuts on his face, neck and limbs, until the time he was taken to a hospital by a vehicle of the excise department. Remith met his fate 14 years after his father, Uthaman (also an RSS worker), was killed almost in the same manner - dragged out of a bus and hacked until he died. Remith was killed to retaliate the murder of K Mohanan, CPI(M)'s branch secretary, at Koothuparambu, not far from Pinarayi.&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">This, according to the local media reports, marks the seventh such political killing so far this year. The BJP is observing a state-wide hartal to mark their protest on Remith's killing. The beginning of political killings in the state dates back to 70s, when Hindu-Muslim conflicts used to happen in Malabar. This gradually turned to RSS-Left conflicts on behalf of both communities and time to time, both parties kept taking lives on both side to keep the tally equal.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Scores of heads have been plucked out of torsos since then. Enormous amount of blood were shed on the roads, party offices, campuses and even within the perceived safety of homes right in front of family members. Gradually, such incidents became routine and ceased to become news. There is no accurate official estimates of how many lives have been terminated. The reasons for such killings are often local issues, sometime as silly as placing one party's hoarding on one spot, which was used by the other party last year, or to put it more simply, just to equal the tally.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why is the state, known as God's own country and takes pride in its high literacy level, fast turning into a hell hole? The reason, according to political analysts, is the renewed vigour among the RSS and BJP units following the show of strength of the party at the national level and the counter measures of CPM in the state to retain their territory.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;There is a feeling among the local BJP workers that there is support from above,&rdquo; said M N Karassery, a well-known political analyst in the state. &ldquo;On the other hand, the CPM workers in the state too feel that they have the silent support of the LDF-government to retaliate,&rdquo; said Karassery.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Karassery is probably right. According to a report, the CPM's state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan urged the party workers to retaliate at political rivals physically.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Every region should have a system to counter the attack from rivals. We should ensure that those who come to attack us do not return from our region. For this, the party should gain strength in every region. Young men and women should be given necessary physical training,&rdquo; the report said.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though Chief Minister Vijayan is an admirer of Narendra Modi and the Centre, the left-hardliners and foot soldiers of the party on the ground doesn't seem to share the admiration. And the only language they understand, especially in the northern part of the state like Kannur, is that of violence. &ldquo;All political parties keep quotation teams (goons) to use when needed. This is nothing but political terrorism, which happens when political parties run out of ideas to fight with but only weapons. That's what terrorists also do.&rdquo;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rise of RSS-BJP</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />The rise of RSS-BJP clout in Kerala post May 2014 when Narendra Modi government came to power bolstered the local BJP-RSS units to take on the rivals. This was subsequently boosted by BJP's improved performance in vote share in 2015 local body polls and 2016 May state assembly polls. Withstanding the strong Left wave that swept through the state, the lone lotus bloomed in Nemam marking the first victory for the party in Kerala Assembly elections. The party has indeed begun to make strong inroads to the bipolar political landscape of the state.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the Assembly elections this year, BJP's vote share rose to10.5 percent as compared to the 6 percent in 2011 Assembly elections, but it has remained flat when compared with the 10.2 percent it scored in 2014 Lok Sabha polls. Seen together with its ambitious ally, Bhartiya Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS), the vote share is about 14 per cent as compared to the 16 per cent the alliance clocked in local body polls last year.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The BDJS contested in 37 seats and garnered 3.9 per cent total vote share while BJP finished with 10.5 per cent. The fact that BJP government is in power at the Centre and the party's new found strength in the State emboldened the State unit. Particularly, it caused more aggression among the &ldquo;party villages&rdquo; in northern side of Kerala, such as Kannur and Kasaragod districts.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the other hand, the left parties too became increasingly aware about the rising threat posed by the RSS-BJP in the state and hence they too started reacting aggressively to any provokation from the RSS camp, often resorting to violent retaliations, with the silent support of Vijayan government.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The bigger question is the silence of Chief Minister Vijayan, who is also holding the home ministry. &ldquo;Had Vijayan acted on time, none of this would have happened. What is the need to deploy party workers to avenge the murder of CPM workers, when you can do so through due legal process seeking the help of state police and judiciary,&rdquo; Karassery asked.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">From a national perspective, Kerala is now passing through a phase of political transition. The RSS-BJP is gaining muscle, the Congress-led UDF front is facing an existential crisis and the left is trying to hard not to lose its hard-won dominant position in the state using all possible means, including that of violence.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">One needn't be surprised if more heads roll in the days ahead. That, if the Vijayan government continues to remain a mute spectator to the situation on the ground and succumbing to party's hardliners. &nbsp;For now, the State is far from being the God's own country.&nbsp;</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/9232_governance1476517702225.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babc1e73031e7ec856e9a3","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"pinarayi"},{"text":"kannur"},{"text":"kerala"},{"text":"rss"},{"text":"bjp"},{"text":"vijayan"},{"text":"chief minister"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57fb6fc4e66f216b816f52ca","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/News-Analysis/2016-10-14/Governance-deficit-in-Gods-own-country/258576","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-15T07:48:29.768Z","udate":"2016-10-17T07:05:36.290Z","expirydate":"2017-02-01T07:42:38.267Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-17T07:05:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"5801df4df568d50da51e5c37","id":"5801df4df568d50da51e5c35","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out9125.mp3","tagsForSearch":"pinarayi,kannur,kerala,rss,bjp,vijayan,chief minister","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

How could we follow him?&rdquo; This is great escapism</span></em>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Albert Einstein was right when he said that only two things were infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and he was not sure about the former. There is no other explanation to building a temple for Gandhiji in Nalgonda district. Metaphorically Gandhiji must be turning in his grave at Raj Ghat in New Delhi after hearing about the temple and people offering various Hindu rituals like Kumkumarchana et al. Not surprisingly, the people behind the temple administration are also spreading rumours that the students, who wish to go abroad for higher studies, could worship Gandhiji at the temple to get visa.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>In a country where hero worship is common and temples have been built to even the filmy heroines, it is not surprising for many. However, it is hard to digest the fact that a temple was constructed for the Father of Nation. If the people behind the temple had read the autobiography of Gandhiji &ldquo;My Experiment with Truth,&rdquo; they would have thought twice before building such temple.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>There was hue and cry when a hillock was named after Gandhiji in Vijayawada in early Seventies with a monument and a library to highlight his literary work. Gandhi Hill, as it is popularly known, contains also a photo exhibition of the Freedom Movement, hundreds of books authored by Gandhiji and a number of Gandhians in the library, a planetarium and a toy train atop the Hill for entertaining children.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>The monument highlights Gandhi&rsquo;s eleven vows&mdash;Non-violence, Truth, Non-stealing, self-discipline, non-possession, bread labour, control of palate, fearlessness, equality of all religions, use locally made goods and remove untouchability.&nbsp;Several people objected to it and even ridiculed the idea of making him larger than life size. The group of Digambara Kavulu blasted the idea. Cherabanda Raju wrote, &ldquo;Parvatalemiti, Puja Mandiralemiti, Aaradhanalemiti, Aarbhatalemiti. Ee desaniki maro Gandhi vaddu. Ee desam marosari mosapovaddu.&rdquo;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>If we recall what Sri Sri has said in Seventies, the future generations would be made to believe that Gandhiji raised his hand stick and roared at the British to leave the country and the British were frightened and left the country. No wonder the history would be rewritten to suit their interests.&nbsp;In early Seventies, setting up of a memorial was objected to. Surprisingly, now there is hardly any response from any corner over the temple for Gandhiji.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>If anybody wants not to follow the high principles of a towering personality, just place him on high pedestal and make him a god. Then one need not follow the principles enunciated by him. One could escape by saying that the great man stuck to the principles because he was god. &ldquo;We are ordinary mortals. How could we follow him?&rdquo; This is the great escapism. I tried to talk to some of the people who were running the temple. They said that they were employees and they do not know anything. Not one of them was wearing Khadi clothes leave alone working on charkha.&nbsp;This is how ultimately the principles of Gandhiji are consigned to flames.&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/gandhi1476518698384.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57babc1e73031e7ec856e9a3","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"gandhi"},{"text":"god"},{"text":"temple"},{"text":"nalgonda district"},{"text":"raj ghat"},{"text":"new delhi"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57fb6fc4e66f216b816f52ca","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/News-Analysis/2016-10-14/Einstein-was-right/258583","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-15T08:05:05.409Z","udate":"2016-10-20T12:55:02.722Z","expirydate":"2017-01-12T08:01:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-17T07:05:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"5801e3313d0de62016ffc442","id":"5801e3313d0de62016ffc440","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","audioImageUrl":"","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out1100.mp3","tagsForSearch":"gandhi,god,temple,nalgonda district,raj ghat,new delhi","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

While the Swedish Academy's decision to select a songwriter, instead of a writer or poet, has earned much praise -- and much criticism too -- its real significance lies in what it means for the definition of literature, and the unnecessary distinction between high and popular culture.</p>\n<p>On social media itself, there have been many who welcomed the award for an abiding musical legend, whose self-written lyrics have been eloquent anthems of iconoclastic protest against stultifying tradition, inequitable status quo and conformity. On the other hand, many disparaged the decision, saying he is \"no writer\", mentioned \"all the great literary works that are lying around, waiting their due credit\", and even that he is a \"university dropout\".&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of the objections seems dubious and self-centred. Is literature only the product of a writer or a poet or a dramatist, and then who is an author anyway? Is it someone who thinks he/she is an author, or someone who is called an author, or someone whose works are known? And then why an educational qualification -- are authors only those with a degree in literature or a diploma in creative writing?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What about the other \"great literary works\"? The Nobel, like many other awards, has never been free from controversy. Many scientists, especially women like Lise Meitner (worked with Otto Hahn on nuclear fission) and Rosalind Watson (made a seminal contribution to Frances Crick and James Watson's double helix model of DNA) were left out, while their male counterparts were honoured. President Barack Obama won the Peace Prize at the beginning of his stint unlike other recipients who had to do something for it.</p>\n<p>Leo Tolstoy, Henrik Ibsen, Mark Twain, Franz Kafka, Anton Chekhov, Graham Greene, Vladimir Nabokov, Jorge Luis Borges, Faiz Ahmed Faiz and so on never received the Nobel Prize. Criticism greeted the selection of so many European authors not known outside their own countries, and even of John Steinbeck -- The New York Times said his \"limited talent is, in his best books, watered down by tenth-rate philosophising\".&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And then to literature itself. Is the oral tradition not literature, or does it have to be printed in book form to deserve the name? Many seminal works -- religious epics, creation sagas, fairy tales and fables, poems and so on existed long before they were reduced to a tangible printed form, studied by researchers and prescribed in syllabi. Were they literature then, or are they now?</p>\n<p>Take some concrete examples. Compare \"If you're traveling the north country fair/Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline/Remember me to one who lives there/For she once was a true love of mine\" with \"Down by the salley gardens my love and I did meet;/She passed the salley gardens with little snow-white feet./She bid me take love easy, as the leaves grow on the tree;/But I, being young and foolish, with her would not agree\".</p>\n<p>Even these two vividly surreal scenarios: \"Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves/The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach/Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow\" with \"Let us go then, you and I,/When the evening is spread out against the sky/Like a patient etherized upon a table.\"</p>\n<p>The first verse in both cases is Dylan and the second writers are William Butler Yeats (Nobel Prize for Literature, 1923) and T.S. Eliot (Nobel Prize for Literature, 1948), respectively.</p>\n<p>In an article for the Smithsonian Institute's online magazine, American historian David C. Ward notes that while Dylan's lyrics can stand alone as poetry \"in terms of the tradition of free verse in the 20th-century\", this was \"a criterion that will not satisfy many\". However, since Dylan \"turned words into music, many of his lyrics are more traditional in the way that they rhyme and scan than critics might admit\".</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it is about personal choice. How many of us have read Mikhail Sholokhov, Selma Lagerlof, Jacinto Benavente, or Yasunari Kawabata because they are Nobel laureates?</p>\n<p>And then what is the big deal about a Nobel, as many, including the likes of Karel Capek and Jean Paul Sartre, have asked?&nbsp;</p>\n</div>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/bob_dylan1476525162137.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"5800c28fdca812202fde46c5","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"social media"},{"text":"bob dylan"},{"text":"nobel prize"},{"text":"literature"},{"text":"leo tolstoy"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57fb6fc4e66f216b816f52ca","status":"Discarded","sourceUrl":"http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/does-bob-dylan-deserve-nobel-prize-literature-51414","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-15T09:52:49.884Z","udate":"2016-10-20T12:45:48.628Z","expirydate":"2016-12-31T09:50:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-17T07:05:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"5801fc716969590e180904b1","id":"5801fc716969590e180904af","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"audioImageUrl":"","tagsForSearch":"social media,bob dylan,nobel prize,literature,leo tolstoy","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

But while a sensational election campaign season has ensured the presence of passionate followers for both candidates within the Indian community, it is plausible that there are several who are all set to exercise their first ever US franchise by voting for neither of the two.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The negativity of the campaign, the personal fight between the candidates has upset Indian American citizens.&nbsp;This kind of mudslinging and personal attacks between candidates is not the usual sight in the American landscape.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Used as we are to highly-decibel campaigns in India, the visceral nature of the American political season this time wouldn't normally surprise us, but it has caught many in the States off guard. Several Indians I spoke to say that the binary choice presents a bleak future over the next four years, with little or no potential redemption from either candidate.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To many in the US, the usually distant view of politicians capitalising on fear, anger and distrust to bring themselves to power, is more real and palpable than ever. US politicians have done so with historic ruthlessness in the past, but never has the mongering of fear of the outsider been more in-your-face.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many Indian Americans this correspondent spoke to said they were 'very afraid' of Trump in power because they believe his unapologetic bigotry won't be kept out of decisions. They therefore support Hillary by default, and not because they actively admire her. Many who don't really stay in tune with the unfolding campaign atmosphere feel Hillary is the only real choice simply because, well, she's a Clinton. Democrat Indians believe Hillary has alienated ardent supporters with an intensifying cloak of corruption and scandal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Hillary is only posturing, I know nothing will happen if she comes to power, there are checks and balances and nothing meaningful will happen,&rdquo; says Manish, who works in Virginia.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A large number of Indian-born supporters of Trump believe he dovetails well with the new political leadership in India, and that a Trump-Modi partnership across issues, including Islamic fundamentalism, terrorism and security would work very well. &ldquo;Trump and Modi are both doers. They would be compatible. There may be a personality clash, but they have firm views on world issues.

Learn these four techniques to use make-up effectively and score at the next big party. <br /><br /><strong>Bronzing</strong><br /><br />Baked bronzers endow a sun-kissed look to your face and make it appear more tan. It can be applied all over for a shimmery effect.<br /><strong><br />Dos:</strong> Draw a numeric &lsquo;3&rsquo; using your bronzer which covers your forehead, cheekbones and jawline, and blend perfectly.<br /><br />Use only baked mineralised bronzers&nbsp; to get the perfect look.<br /><br /><strong>Don&rsquo;ts:</strong> Never use bronzers excessively! Blending is the key for this product. <br /><br />Never use a bronzer which is more than two shades darker than your skin tone.<br /><br />Avoid applying a bronzer on your nose &mdash; no, it does not make your nose look thinner.<br /><br /><strong>Blushing</strong><br /><br />Brush away your chubby-face woes by applying chocolate-brown blush on the hollows of your cheeks, below the chin and on the edges of nose. This will give your make-up a three-dimensional effect by creating shadows.<br /><br /><strong>Dos: </strong>With shades of pink and peach being popular choices, one should them wisely. Opt for pink if you have a fair or olive complexion and peaches if you are more yellow or tan in tone.<br /><br />Strong blushers are out of fashion but contouring with a dark brown hue below your cheekbones, on your chin and on sides of the nose could be done.<br /><br />Use sponges to apply your blush as it will lead to a superbly blended and all-natural effect. <br /><strong><br />Don&rsquo;ts:</strong>Don&rsquo;t create very harsh lines.<br /><br />Avoid using a blush that is in contrast to your lips. Instead, choose from the same family of colours that you have chosen for your lipstick.<br /><br />Using cream blush is a definite no-no for this season.<br /><br /><strong>Highlighting</strong><br /><br />If you are already blessed with sharp features but still want to appear more chiseled, highlighting is what you need. Apply a highlighter that has some amount of sheen on the upper part of you cheekbones, nose and chin.&nbsp;You can also go a bit further by using some of it on your lip&rsquo;s cupid bow as well.<br /><br /><strong>Dos:</strong>Use an iridescent colour palette for highlighters. Pearl and gold highlighters are ideal for the festive season.<br /><br />Use a matte finish foundation to make the highlighter hues show better.<br /><br /><strong>Don&rsquo;ts:</strong>Never use a highlighter on the centre of your cheeks or forehead, or full nose; it&rsquo;ll only make your face appear made-up. <br /><br />Silver, copper and rust are a big no-no when it comes to highlighting. <br />Glossy and shimmery highlighters are pass&eacute; &ndash; try highlighters with a luminous sheen to infuse luxury to your make-up.<br /><br /><strong>Luminising</strong><br /><br />The luminiser is usually white and sparkling and can be applied on any <br />part of the face that you want to draw attention to.<br /><br /><strong>Dos:</strong>Use a matte make-up base to enhance the effect of the luminiser.<br /><br />You can apply it on the corner of your eyes if you have dark circles to make your eyes appear brighter. You can use it on the corner of your lips, above the cheekbones and eyelids too.<br /><br />Try to get a shade that matches your skin tone. A shade lighter would also do.<br /><br /><strong>Don&rsquo;ts:</strong>Avoid applying luminiser all over the face as it can be shinier than it seems. <br /><br />&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t use luminisers in huge quantities.<br /><br /><strong><em>(The author is the executive director, Alps Beauty Clinic, Delhi)</em></strong></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/look1476527226489.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"57baabc5ecbc9256e95c1763","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"make-up"},{"text":"chiselled look"},{"text":"nose"},{"text":"thinner"},{"text":"blushing"},{"text":"highlighting"},{"text":"luminising"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/574675/make-up-chiselled-look.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-15T10:27:12.030Z","udate":"2016-10-17T05:36:25.525Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-17T05:36:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"580204806969590e1809051a","id":"580204806969590e18090518","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6888.mp3","tagsForSearch":"make-up,chiselled look,nose,thinner,blushing,highlighting,luminising","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

These <a href=\"http://wholegrainscouncil.org/whole-grains-101/definition-of-whole-grains\">include</a> barley, buckwheat, bulgur wheat, corn and popcorn, millet, oats, quinoa, brown rice, wild rice, rye, triticale (a wheat-rye hybrid) and spelt wheat.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"align-right \" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /><img src=\"https://62e528761d0685343e1c-f3d1b99a743ffa4142d9d7f1978d9686.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/65300/width237/image-20141124-19636-u8azap.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n<figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Buckwheat is a fibrous wholegrain cereal loaded with heart health benefits.</span> <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ervins_strauhmanis/9548721480/in/photolist-cqJPPE-ePJo3b-8BpWRq-fBd6ms-6X8k4B-oXx4jb-3h5ny8-eMZh1e-6XpdKX-4j69X-o7jbCT-fxMGdY-fxxugg-8BpWFE-pgpYYt-4kbee-nMPswg-ePwXSx-32Kce1-8y2DVX/\">Ervins Strauhmanis/Flickr</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC BY</a></span></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The health benefits of some fibres have been studied more extensively than others. <a href=\"http://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/hn-2805007#hn-2805007-uses\">Beta-glucan</a>, for instance, is a soluble fibre found in oats and barley. It helps to lower total and LDL (bad) cholesterol.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/71/5/1123.full\">Arabinoxylan</a> is a wheat fibre that improves blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/supplement/psyllium\">Psyllium</a>, which comes from the the seed coat of the Plantago plant, can add an extra fibre boost. You buy it at the supermarket as a dry ingredient and it forms a gel when mixed with liquid.

Eat more fruit and vegetables</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Australian <a href=\"https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/\">Dietary Guidelines</a> recommend we eat two serves of fruit and five serves of vegetables a day. While over <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4364.0.55.007main+features12011-12\">50% of adults meet the fruit target</a>, less than 7% of people do so for vegetables.</p>\n<figure class=\"align-left \" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /><img src=\"https://62e528761d0685343e1c-f3d1b99a743ffa4142d9d7f1978d9686.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/65305/width237/image-20141124-19608-oe3nyv.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n<figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Increased vegetable and fruit intake is associated with higher levels of potassium, which assists in reducing blood pressure.</span>&nbsp;</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g4490\">2014 review</a> of six studies covering more than 670,000 people found that for each extra serve of fruit or vegetables eaten each day, the risk of dying from heart disease was reduced by an additional 4%.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Higher intakes of <a href=\"http://www.ars.usda.gov/aboutus/docs.htm?docid=4142\">phytonutrients</a> contained in fruits and vegetables, such as polyphenols, vitamin C, carotenoids and flavonoids, are thought to help slow hardening of arteries and blood clotting.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Eating more fruit and vegetables also increases your potassium intake, which helps reduce blood pressure by <a href=\"http://www.bloodpressureuk.org/microsites/salt/Home/Whypotassiumhelps\">cancelling</a> some of the harmful effect of salt.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Focus on healthy fats</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For optimal heart health, it&rsquo;s important get the right balance of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/health-check-cooking-oils-to-eat-and-avoid-31346\">healthy fats</a> versus unhealthy fats. This means avoiding fatty meats, commercial pastries, cakes and biscuits, fried, take-away and processed foods and commercial fats such as palm and coconut oil.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Instead, choose mono-unsaturated fats, long-chain polyunsaturated fats (including omega-3 fats), nuts and seeds, avocados, olives, oily fish, mono-unsaturated and polyunsaturated oils and margarine, including olive oil and canola. This helps to reduce total and LDL cholesterol and optimise HDL (good) cholesterol.</p>\n<figure class=\"align-right \" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /><img src=\"https://62e528761d0685343e1c-f3d1b99a743ffa4142d9d7f1978d9686.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/65309/width237/image-20141124-19630-wdh7a6.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n<figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Avocados are a great source of healthy fat.</span> <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"http://one.aap.com.au/#/search/fruit%20and%20vegetables?q=%7B%22pageSize%22:25,%22pageNumber%22:4%7D\">Paul Miller/ AAP</a></span></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A recent <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25246449\">American Heart Foundation study</a> of more than 4,000 people who had survived a heart attack found that among those following low-carbohydrate diets, high intakes of animal fats and protein were harmful compared to fat and protein from plant-based diets.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Those with the highest intakes of protein and fat from animal sources had a 51% greater risk of death from heart disease compared to the lowest. Factoring in the change in diet following a heart attack, the excess risk of dying from heart disease was still 53%.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. If you drink alcohol, have a moderate intake</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While no alcohol is safest to reduce your risk of developing some cancers, there is a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23641990\">J-shaped relationship</a> between alcohol consumption and death rates among people with heart disease: moderate intake is associated with the best survival rates.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21737162\">2013 study</a> of more than 11,000 Italians who had recently had a heart attack, those who drank wine in moderation (up to 500 millilitres per day) had a 12-13% lower risk of heart attack, stroke or dying from heart disease over the next 3.5 years compared to non-drinkers.</p>\n<figure class=\"align-left \" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /><img src=\"https://62e528761d0685343e1c-f3d1b99a743ffa4142d9d7f1978d9686.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/65307/width237/image-20141124-19612-1p76kow.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n<figcaption><span class=\"caption\">If you&rsquo;re a heavy drinker, it&rsquo;s wise to cut back.</span> <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/wayneandwax/14450756495/in/set-72157630415212866\">Wayne Marshall/Flickr</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-NC-SA</a></span></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Over seven years of follow-up, both moderate and heavy (more than 500 ml per day) wine drinkers had a 15-20% lower risk of dying compared to non-drinkers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some of the protective mechanisms include higher levels of HDL (good) cholesterol, better insulin sensitivity, less inflammation and lower tendency to blood clots. Wine, especially red wine, contains phytonutrients including flavonoids, tannin and other phenolic compounds.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, for those who are non-drinkers, taking it up after a heart attack is not necessarily recommended, so check with your doctor. For those who are heavy drinkers, drinking less is wise.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">5. Cut down on salt</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Reducing salt lowers your <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23558162\">blood pressure</a> and this reduces your risk of heart disease and stroke.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"align-right \" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /><img src=\"https://62e528761d0685343e1c-f3d1b99a743ffa4142d9d7f1978d9686.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/65308/width237/image-20141124-19608-1lsfk6x.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n<figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Lowering sodium intake can help protect against heart disease.</span>&nbsp;</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">About <a href=\"http://www.heartfoundation.org.au/healthy-eating/food-and-nutrition-facts/Pages/salt.aspx\">75% of the salt we eat</a> comes from processed foods such as potato crisps, salted nuts, packet soups and sauces, canned foods, pies, sausage rolls, hot chips and pizza. Cutting down processed foods and take-away will help reduce your salt intake from an average of nine grams a day to the recommended maximum of six grams (2300 mg sodium).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Choose foods that have less than 120 mg sodium per 100 grams of food on the nutrition information panel. Also avoid adding salt during cooking or at the table.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Putting it all together</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here&rsquo;s how you might put this information into practice:</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>\n<p>Start your day with a wholegrain breakfast cereal or rolled oats with psyllium sprinkled on top</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Munch on fruit, nuts or popcorn for snacks</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make a salad sandwich on wholegrain bread with canned tuna or salmon for lunch</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At dinner, cover a quarter of your plate with a lean protein, legumes or a mix of both, cover half your plate with five or more brightly coloured vegetables and make the last quarter a grain like quinoa or wild rice.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Is it worth the effort?</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It&rsquo;s not always easy changing dietary patterns established over a lifetime. Some might wonder whether eating more healthily after a heart attack is worth the effort.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is. Consider the results of the <a href=\"http://www.channing.harvard.edu/nhs/\">Nurses&rsquo; Health Study</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hpfs/\">Health Professional Follow-up Study</a>, which tracked more than 4,000 adult men and women who had survived an initial heart attack over nine years. Those who improved their eating habits the <em>most</em> after the heart attack had a 29% lower risk of dying from anything and a 40% lower risk of dying from heart disease compared to those who did not improve their eating habits or ate worse.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The researchers also compared people&rsquo;s eating habits from baseline to after a heart attack. The biggest improvements made by men were for eating more wholegrains, omega-3 fats, fruits, vegetables and for reducing red/processed meat, trans fats and salt. For women it was increasing wholegrains and reducing trans fats, red/processed meat and salt.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have survived a heart attack, your doctor will prescribe medications to manage your risk factors. They might provide dietary advice, or you can see an <a href=\"http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/find-an-apd/\">accredited practising dietitian</a> for a personalised plan.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Use your second chance to eat better as well. Any improvements you can make to what you eat and drink will help stack the odds in your favour.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/33194/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>(The author is a &nbsp;Professor in Nutrition and Dietetics,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-newcastle-1060\">University of Newcastle</a>.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/foods1476528530780.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"5800c28fdca812202fde46c5","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"food"},{"text":"tips"},{"text":"life"},{"text":"heart attack"},{"text":"wholegrain cereals"},{"text":"fruit"},{"text":"vegetables"},{"text":"dietary guidelines"},{"text":"phytonutrients"},{"text":"healthy fats"},{"text":"blood pressure"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/five-food-tips-could-save-your-life-after-heart-attack-51421","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-15T10:48:58.210Z","udate":"2016-10-17T05:36:25.525Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-17T05:36:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"5802099aed1ec1249a587c0f","id":"5802099aed1ec1249a587c0d","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out6846.mp3","tagsForSearch":"food,tips,life,heart attack,wholegrain cereals,fruit,vegetables,dietary guidelines,phytonutrients,healthy fats,blood pressure","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

{"_id":"580211250631da5df9127f6e","title":"Health Horizons: An Ayurvedic Approach to a Healthy Life","categoryId":"571a2884cca9841545676789","sectionId":"57eb8e75bec71f6cb1a62d18","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Gargling</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If for some reason such as travelling one is unable to clean the teeth in the morning, gargling with water will help. This also cleans the teeth and the tongue and refreshes the mouth to some extent. It removes unpleasant odor and stickiness in the mouth and any <em>Kapha </em>accumulated in the throat and mouth. Ideally, after brushing the teeth, the mouth should be rinsed with sesame or mustard oil. This process is called <em>kavalagraha. </em>It strengthens the teeth and gums, prevents toothache, reduces sensitivity to hot, cold and sour substances (that sometimes cause toothache), helps chew tough and hard substances easily, improves the quality of voice, and boosts taste perception and appetite. Regular rinsing of the mouth, gargling and <em>kavalagraha </em>prevents drying of the throat and chapping of the lips.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Substances with pungent essences boiled in water arc excellent for gargling, after, straining them and when lukewarm. They clean the mouth and reduce any unpleasant odor, Witholding of decoction in the mouth is referred to as &lsquo;<em>gandusa.&rsquo; </em>When the liquid in the mouth can be moved around, the process is called <em>&lsquo;kavala.&rsquo; Kavala </em>helps to treat ailments of head and ear, dullness, sleepiness, anorexia, spasmodic torticollis, sinusitis, chronic cold (rhinitis) and nausea.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Head care</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The head should be oiled daily with sesame, coconut, olive, almond or mustard oil. This prevents hair loss, graying, balding (alopecia unless genetic), headache, drying of the scalp and other <em>Vata </em>diseases. It strengthens the head, forehead, eyes, ears and other sensory organs. The quality of hair improves as the hair become stronger, smoother, longer and darker. Also, the glow of the face increases. Application of sesame oil on the head brings good and sound sleep. Combing the hair after oiling cleanses and beautifies the hair.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Body massage: Abhyanga (oleation)</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just as applying oil to pots, dry leather and axles of wheels lubricates and strengthens them, oiling the body makes it stronger and softens the skin. Oil protects the body against diseases caused by <em>Vata.</em>Skin is an important organ where <em>Vata </em>accumulates. The pores in the skin are filled with the heat of<em>Pitta </em>which absorb the oil applied and calms the <em>Vata. </em>Applying oil also destroys premature aging, fatigue, wrinkles, roughness and dryness. It clears the vision, strengthens the body and smoothens the skin making it soft and attractive. It also provides relief from body odor, dirt, itching, odor of sweat, heaviness, dullness and fatigue.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Strokes during body massage should be in the direction of hair growth on the skin. Too much force should not be used while massaging. Soft, smooth strokes are adequate. Applying oil in the sunlight speeds absorption. Massage not only gives disease-free skin but also strengthens the muscles. Massage or <em>abhyanga </em>(oleation) is extremely beneficial in neuro-muscular weakness, arthritis and muscular tension.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Karnapurana: Oil as an ear drop</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to <em>Ayurveda, </em>apply oil in the ears daily. This prevents ailments like deafness, defective hearing, spasmodic torticollis, lockjaw (tetanus) and other <em>Vata </em>related ear problems. In a healthy ear, oil should be retained for two minutes. When suffering from earache, oil should be retained in the ear till the pain is relieved. This can be done by rubbing the painful area and pressing at the base of the ear.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Feet massage</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Applying oil on the feet every day is also very beneficial. It reduces and prevents roughness, dryness, fatigue, numbness, laxity, &lsquo;cracked heels,&rsquo; reduced blood flow, tense muscles, sciatica and other <em>Vata</em>ailments. It also improves the eyesight. In ancient times, its beneficial effects led the experts to make it a religious ritual to be performed daily after morning ablutions, every time after urination, before meals and before bathing. Besides oil, ice, bottle gourd, cucumber and other medicinal substances are used for foot massage to alleviate many kinds of diseases or deformities.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Nasya kriya: Oil as a nasal drop</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The nose is considered a pathway to the sinuses. Hence, medicinal preparations poured into the nostrils can reach every part of the head. Normally, oil drops should be added to the nostrils during monsoon, winter and spring seasons when there is no cloud cover.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This should be done daily after clearing of the bowels, cleaning of teeth and oiling the hair. The head should hang backward on the back of a chair, and a few drops of warm oil (indirectly heated by steam or by keeping it in hot water) should be placed in each nostril using a dropper and then inhaled. Oil should be applied in the nostrils drop by drop, in one nostril and then the other. While putting drops into one nostril, the other nostril should be closed. Any nasal secretions during <em>nasya </em>should be discharged from the mouth.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Lukewarm clarified butter made from cow&rsquo;s milk is best for nasya. It provides relief in common cold, headache and other cephalagic disorders. It also enhances memory power. Olive oil and Almond oil are also good for nasya.</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After <em>nasya, </em>lie down on your back for a minute or so but do not fall asleep. <em>Nasya </em>cures all ailments that are caused above the neck.

A number of simple practices can help in maintaining sugar-levels which in turn helps in controlling diabetes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1. Diet: </strong>A healthy and nutritious diet is the primary and easiest method of diabetic control. It is important to enjoy the food consumed while overeating and poor choice of food should be avoided.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Advisable foods include:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">a) Cooked, raw or roasted vegetables: Low carbohydrate vegetables like onions, Brussel sprouts, mushrooms, tomatoes etc. along with dips such as hummus, salsa or different seasonings like garlic, rosemary pepper.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">b) Low Calorie drinks: Cold tea and water infused with vegetable and fruits.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">c) Greens: Kale, spinach and chard, either roasted in olive oil or in combination with other vegetables.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">d) Melons or Berries: Plain or mixed with yogurt.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2. Exercise: </strong>Among the many benefits of exercise, one important feature is reduction in glucose levels of the blood. Individuals having type 2 diabetes show an excess of glucose in the blood. This is caused by their body&rsquo;s inability to create enough insulin to process the glucose, or on the grounds that their body doesn&rsquo;t utilize insulin appropriately. Muscles are capable of glucose absorption without insulin during exercise, thereby resulting in a reduction in glucose level.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3.</strong><strong>Medicine: </strong>Depending on various factors, the appropriate medication is prescribed by the doctor.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/diabetes1476531794990.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"579363ed4c0ab56541be1c26","catType":"Health","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"diet"},{"text":"foods"},{"text":"exercise"},{"text":"medicine"},{"text":"endocrinology"},{"text":"dr hanish gupta"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57dd1957fa77826b285224e6","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://blog.lybrate.com/2016/08/22/diabetes-control-where-do-we-rank-diet-exercise-medicines/","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-15T11:43:21.876Z","udate":"2016-10-17T05:36:25.525Z","expirydate":"2016-12-30T18:30:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-17T05:36:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"58021659ed1ec1249a587cde","id":"58021659ed1ec1249a587cdc","publishedBy":"57dd3c9efb61356b41a1bc72","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out4722.mp3","tagsForSearch":"diet,foods,exercise,medicine,endocrinology,dr hanish gupta","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

They're the bane of the Indian woman's existance. But even though women hate their thighs, there's precious little they do to tone them up. While jogging and brisk walking do help to an extent, it makes sense to do exercises speicfically directed at toning up the thigh muscles.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #666600;\">Swimming</span></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Swimmers have excellent thighs, as swimming tones up every part of the body, especially arms and thighs. Swimming is excellent for stress reduction as well, so if you know how to swim and have access to a pool, I would strongly recommend that you give this sport a shot. Certain instructers hold adult swimming classes, for those adults who want to learn swimming, but not in a class filled with small children and babies. So if you want to learn how to swim speak to your clubhouse or the coach there. Perhaps something could be worked out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #666600;\">Where's the chair?</span></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Stand with your back towards the wall. Let your feet be about one and a half feet away from the wall, and shoulder width apart. Slowly, with your back, shoulders and butt still pressed firmly against the wall, bend down from your knees, as if you are sitting on a chair, so your thighs are parallel to the floor. They should not go any lower as your knees would get strained. Similarly, make sure your knees do not extend to beyond your toes. Thus, your knees and feet should be aligned. Stay put for around 30 seconds initially, and increase this duration by a few seconds every day. Pretty soon you should be able to stand like this for at least five to seven minutes at a time.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #666600;\">Leg lifts</span></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Lie on your left side. Prop your head up with your left hand. Keep your legs straight, and lift your right leg up, up, as high as possible without bending your knees. Slowly, bring it down.

Bend, leaning in front, until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Once again, make sure your knees do not overextend your toes. Feel the stretch in your upper thigh. Do this ten times, and hold for around 10 seconds every time. Slowly increase the duration and the number of stretches.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #666600;\">Forward lunge</span></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Remember, for most exercises, you need to stand with your legs shoulder-width apart. Stand up straight, and then extend your left leg by taking a big step. Bend your knees so your left thigh is parallel to the floor. Your back should be straight. Do not lean in front. Your left knee should not extend your left foot. Slowly straighten, and repeat with right foot. Do not bounce. Do this ten times to start out, and slowly keep increasing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #666600;\">The big squeeze</span></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Here's a great exercise you can do even as you sitting on your desk and read this!

{"_id":"58021e6e1f709609dd368546","title":"The Great - Hearted Monkey","categoryId":"573eb837b2f1dbd356a23364","sectionId":"57eb8ff4af76df6bbfd6adfd","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">In a forest glade, by the side of River Ganges, high on the mountains there lived about eighty thousand monkeys along with their giant monkey king. And by the side of the clear gushing water stood a tall shady tree bearing big beautiful juicy golden fruits commonly called mangoes.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">All the monkeys just loved these mangoes and ate them off almost as soon as they had ripened. Which was a very good thing as their wise giant king had warned them not to let a single juicy fruit fall into the river. Because if the current carried even one of these fruits down <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the river</span> to the land where the men lived, they would surely come in search of this delicious <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">fruit</span> and destroy the peace in the land of the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">monkeys</span>.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">It so happened that a branch of this tree hung low over <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the river</span> and a mango that was hidden behind an ant's nest ripened and fell off without anyone's knowledge. It was taken down south by the rapid flow of <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the river</span> and reached the city of Benaras.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">One fine morning when King Brahmadutta of Benaras was bathing in <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the river</span>between two nets, a couple of fishermen found a bright golden <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">fruit</span> caught in the mesh of the net. Very excited they took it to show the King. The King examined the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">fruit</span> carefully and asked where it had come from and what it was called. The fishermen did not know much about it but guessed that it must have flowed down <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the river</span> from the valleys of the far-flung Himalayas.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">He then asked them to cut the mango and tasted a slice. It was simply delicious. He shared the rest of it with his ministers and Queen who loved its divine flavour.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">A few days passed, but the King could not get this exotic <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">fruit</span> out of his mind. He could not work; rest or sleep for want of some more. Finally he could bear it no longer and set sail in search of it. He organised a fleet of rafts and sailed up <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the river</span> accompanied by his men and a few fishermen.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Many days and many nights went by and they passed many valleys until they finally came to the one where the mango tree stood. Mission accomplished, the King was delighted and began enjoying the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">mangoes</span> to his heart's content. Finally, that night, the King lay down to sleep under the mango tree while his faithful soldiers stood guard. Fires were lit on either side for protection against wild animals.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">In the middle of the night when the guards had dozed off to sleep, the<span class=\"IL_SPAN\">monkeys</span> came and finished off all the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">mangoes</span> that were left on the tree. The King awoke with all the noise and ordered his guards to shoot at the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">monkeys</span>so that they could feast on monkey flesh along with the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">mangoes</span>.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">On hearing this, the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">monkeys</span> trembled with fear and escaped to inform their King. They told him what had happened and he promised to save them. But for that he had to come up with a plan.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">So he climbed up the tree and swung across <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the river</span> with the help of a branch. He found a bamboo shoot which he measured and cut carefully, and then tied one end of it around his waist. The other end he tied around a tree trunk. He had decided to leap back to the mango tree and help the rest of the<span class=\"IL_SPAN\">monkeys</span> across over the bridge that he had made with the help of the bamboo shoot.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">But alas... he had not taken into account the portion that he had tied around his waist. So when the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">monkey king</span> sprang back into the mango grove he was just able to cling to a branch of the mango tree. He quickly summoned his<span class=\"IL_SPAN\">monkeys</span> to climb over his back and onto the reed in order to escape to the other side. In this way, eighty thousand <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">monkeys</span> climbed over his back one by one and made it to safety.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">But unfortunately there was one evil monkey who hated his leader and wanted to destroy him. His name was Devadutta. This mean monkey purposely jumped hard over his poor king's back and broke it, while he himself escaped to the other bank.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">&nbsp;King Brahmadutta, who had been awake for awhile, had observed this whole episode. He felt extremely sorry for the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">monkey king</span> and asked his men to help lower him to the ground. He then had him gently bathed and wrapped in a soft yellow cloth and asked him why he had sacrificed himself for his tribe. The great monkey answered that as he was their guide and chief, they were his children and it was his sacred duty to protect them. He had absolutely no regrets as he had ensured their safety. He also went on to say that the King should always be mindful of his subjects' welfare even at the cost of his own. Saying this the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">monkey king</span> died at peace with himself.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">King Brahmadutta had learnt a great deal that day. He ordered his men to organise a funeral fit for a King. He then built a shrine in the monkey king's memory where he offered flowers and lit candles and incense.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">On returning to Benaras, he built another shrine there and asked his people to pay homage to this great soul. He always remembered the last words of the<span class=\"IL_SPAN\">monkey king</span> and ruled his subjects with wisdom and compassion. The people in his kingdom were eternally grateful to the great-hearted monkey.</span></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/great_hearted_monkey1476533863402.jpeg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"5800ca160eac6818dc69eadd","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"river ganges"},{"text":"king"},{"text":"monkey"},{"text":"fruit"},{"text":"benaras"},{"text":"jataka tales"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57fb6fc4e66f216b816f52ca","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.indiaparenting.com/stories/84_800/the-great-hearted-monkey.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-15T12:17:50.534Z","udate":"2016-10-20T12:38:36.283Z","expirydate":"2016-12-24T12:14:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-17T07:05:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"58021e6e1f709609dd368548","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"id":"58021e6e1f709609dd368546","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","audioImageUrl":"","ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out3883.mp3","tagsForSearch":"river ganges,king,monkey,fruit,benaras,jataka tales","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

The stork always had a full meal. As the years went by, the st<span class=\"IL_SPAN\">ork</span> grew older and weaker. His ability to catch fish diminished. At times he would even starve. He knew he had to do something to survive.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">One day he stood by the side of the tank with a very forlorn look on his face. The frogs, fish and crabs wondered why he was not trying to catch any food. A big crab asked him what the matter was. The <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">stork</span> answered that he was sad because all <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the fish</span> in <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the tank</span> were going to die and he would have to starve. He said that he had heard that people were going to fill <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the tank</span> with mud and grow crops over it. <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">The fish</span> were very worried and asked the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">stork</span> to help them.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">stork</span> offered to take all of them to a bigger tank some distance away. But he said that he needed to rest between trips because of his age. He would only be able to carry a few fish at a time.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">stork</span> took a beakful of fish on his first trip. He flew to a big rock and had a good meal. He rested awhile, and when he was hungry again, he took a second trip. In this manner, he took a trip each time that he was hungry.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The big crab in <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the tank</span> also wanted to save himself and he requested the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">tork</span> to take him too. The <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">stork</span> thought it was a good idea to try a new dish.

All he could see was dry land. He questioned the&nbsp;<span class=\"IL_SPAN\">stork</span> about this. The <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">stork</span> laughed wickedly and pointed to the rock below where <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the crab</span> saw a heap of fish bones. <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">The crab</span> realized that he was to be the stork's next meal. So <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">the crab</span> dug his claws into the stork's neck and would not let go till the <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">stork</span> fell to the ground. <span class=\"IL_SPAN\">The crab</span> then cut off the stork's head and returned home to show it to all the other fish and share the story of his adventure.</span></p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/stork_and_crab1476534260788.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"5800ca160eac6818dc69eadd","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"stork"},{"text":"panchatantra"},{"text":"crab"},{"text":"adventure"},{"text":"fish"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57fb6fc4e66f216b816f52ca","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://www.indiaparenting.com/stories/85_796/the-stork-and-the-crab.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-15T12:24:27.364Z","udate":"2016-10-20T12:39:24.613Z","expirydate":"2017-03-01T12:20:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-17T07:05:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"58021ffb3d0de62016ffc71e","id":"58021ffb3d0de62016ffc71c","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","audioImageUrl":"","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out1584.mp3","tagsForSearch":"stork,panchatantra,crab,adventure,fish","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}

The exchange with Don Cheadle is a particularly hilarious moment as Hart leans on his loud and annoying persona to disturb the Marvel actor.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After the meta opening sequence, the movie makes way for the actual show.

I got a great response from the audience when I performed (with his band Brian Molley Quartet) at RIFF (Rajasthan International Folk Festival) 2016 on Friday... which is great and positive. There is an enormous market for music in India.\"<br /><br />\"From classical, folk to even Bollywood, everything is a big part of the culture here. I am just trying to be open minded as I can when I make music here. It's a vital thing to be a musician and be open minded as there are many things that you can learn,\" he told IANS on the sidelines of the festival that is currently taking place at Mehrangarh Fort here.<br /><br />The album, which he made with Rajasthani folk artistes, comprises jazz, world music and Rajasthani folk and it has been tentatively titled \"Journeys in Hand\", personifying the collaboration of the musicians from the two countries. The album will release next year.<br /><br />Talking about his experience working with these musicians, he said: \"The one thing I really like about folk musicians whom I met is that they are very open minded, which is really great, especially when you are from different music backgrounds. Rajasthani folk music is great, it's such an incredible form of music.\"<br /><br />Molley also says he is trying to bring possibility of wider things that one can do with these art forms to preserve them for future.<br /><br />\"We try and develop the possibility of that music with these collaborations and to preserve it. We are looking forward to come up with more ideas on how we can mix it well with many other associations,\" he said.<br /><br />Since 2012, Molley is performing with his band members -- Tom Gibbs on piano, Mario Caribe on bass and Stuart Brown on drums. In spring 2013, the band recorded their debut album \"CLOCK (BGMM)\", which released to critical acclaim in October that year.<br /><br />In 2014, the quartet made appearances at Glasgow and Manchester Jazz Festivals and at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe as part of the prestigious Creative Scotland curated 'Made in Scotland' programme, in addition to an extensive Britain tour in autumn.<br /><br />Brian Molley Quartet performed at RIFF for the first time in October 2015.<br /><br />\"We did perform at RIFF last year and that was the time we took a short tour of India as a band. This was the time when we learnt some of their (folk artistes) music in the practical sense. There are specific things about Rajasthani music and rhythmic structure, which is amazing,\" he said.<br /><br />\"We were very clear of making things open enough and bring some sort of elements of harmony and development through this album,\" he said.</p>","iconUrl":"http://media.namaste.in/articles/Brian_Molley1476680238866.jpg","audioUrl":"","youtubeUrl":"","publishersId":"5801cf753d0de62016ffc319","catType":"Literature","stateId":"national","tags":[{"text":"brian molley"},{"text":"rajasthani folk artistes"},{"text":"saxophonist"},{"text":"jazz"},{"text":"music"}],"langIdentifier":"en","mediaType":"Image","artcleType":"Article","pollOptions":[],"createBy":"57fb6fc4e66f216b816f52ca","status":"Published","sourceUrl":"http://smtv24x7.com/english-news-1576-enormous-market-for-music-in-india-scottish-musician.html","shouldDisplayInBrowser":false,"priority":99999,"shouldDisplayInHome":false,"cdate":"2016-10-17T04:57:27.161Z","udate":"2016-10-20T12:45:06.344Z","expirydate":"2016-12-01T04:53:00.000Z","publishedOn":"2016-10-17T07:05:00.000Z","type":"com.kuku.namaste.Article","statsId":"58045a37ed1ec1249a588588","id":"58045a37ed1ec1249a588586","publishedBy":"57dbe3bca829907be778220f","audioImageUrl":"","pollStartDate":null,"pollEndDate":null,"ttsUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kukuapp1/tts_output/fest_out5779.mp3","tagsForSearch":"brian molley,rajasthani folk artistes,saxophonist,jazz,music","updatedBy":"Tags search2"}
